# General Hugo Configuration Options

title: "Basho Documentation"
baseURL: "https://docs.basho.com/"
languageCode: "en-us"

# Use YAML for front matter, rather than TOML
metaDataFormat: "yaml"

# Have Hugo generate `id`s for all header elements, without the default sha1
# string appended. This means that anchors will be unique to a page, but _not_
# to the site.
blackfriday:
  plainIDAnchors: true

# Ignore files (such as the reference links list) on build
ignoreFiles: [
    "\\_reference-links.md$",

# Default directory to build the completed site

  # Project Descriptions
  # ====================
  # These description elements lay out the what and where of projects, detailing
  # the name of the project, the version history (as far as the contemporary
  # docs are concerned), and the past and present location of the given project.
  #
  # These structures are somewhat frustrating, as we want to expose them to both
  # the Hugo generation logic, and live pages at load-time. This entails
  # duplicating the information both here (or in the data/ directory) for Hugo,
  # and somewhere in static/ to be read by the live pages. Assuming we don't
  # want to repeat ourselves and manually edit multiple files when updating this
  # information -- which we don't -- this will require us to use the below data
  # as a Source of Truth, and copy it out of this file.  
  # The way we do that is with `rake generate_versions_metadata`.
  #
  # The map should contain elements in the form,
  #
  #    <project_desc>:                          /* 1 */
  #      project_name: "<Title Name>"           /* 2 */
  #      path: "<path>"                         /* 3 */
  #      archived_path: "<path>"
  #      releases:                              /* 4 */
  #        - ["<version>", "<version>", ...]
  #        - ["<version>", "<version>", ...]
  #      latest:        "<version>"             /* 5 */
  #      lts:           "<version>"
  #      archived_url:  "<URI>"                 /* 6 */
  #
  # 1. The project descriptor must match some contents' `project:` front matter.
  #    This should be all lowercase with underscores for spaces---code, really.
  # 2. A reader-friendly project name. Spaces and caps are welcome. ex; if the
  #    `project_desc` is `riak_kv`, the `project_name` should be `"Riak KV"`.  
  #    NB. Currently the areas that this title is used are spatially small. As
  #    such the titles should be kept below ~12 characters. "DataPlatform" is
  #    the text these elements were sized with.
  # 3. The `path` is the on-disk relative path from the content root. In Hugo,
  #    the content root is '/content/', on S3 the root is simply '/'.
  #    If the project was moved from the Middleman site to Hugo, the
  #    `archived_path` is the on-disk relative path of the previous directory.
  #    TODO: `archived_path` should probably be optional. I don't believe it
  #           currently is.
  # 4. The `releases` list-of-lists is organized oldest to newest, grouped by
  #    release set (ex. the 2.0.* series is one list, followed b the 2.1.*
  #    series).
  # 5. `latest` and `lts` versions are the current head-of-development and long-
  #    term-support releases respectively. `lts` is optional.
  #    TODO: These should probably be release sets, not a specific version.
  # 6. If the project was moved from the Middleman site to Hugo, the
  #    `archived_url` is the URL to the newest deprecated page.
  #    This option is optional.
