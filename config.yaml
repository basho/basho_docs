  # Project Descriptions
  # ====================
  # These description elements lay out the what and where of projects, detailing
  # the name of the project, the version history (as far as the contemporary
  # docs are concerned), and the past and present location of the given project.
  #
  # These structures are somewhat frustrating, as we want to expose them to both
  # the Hugo generation logic, and live pages at load-time. This entails
  # duplicating the information both here (or in the data/ directory) for Hugo,
  # and somewhere in static/ to be read by the live pages. Assuming we don't
  # want to repeat ourselves and manually edit multiple files when updating this
  # information -- which we don't -- this will require us to use the below data
  # as a Source of Truth, and copy it out of this file.  
  # The way we do that is with `rake generate_versions_metadata`.
  #
  # The map should contain elements in the form,
  #
  #    <project_desc>:                          /* 1 */
  #      project_name: "<Title Name>"           /* 2 */
  #      project_name_html: '<HTML>'            /* 2 */
  #      path: "<path>"                         /* 3 */
  #      archived_path: "<path>"                /* 3 */
  #      releases:                              /* 4 */
  #        - ["<version>", "<version>", ...]
  #        - ["<version>", "<version>", ...]
  #      latest:        "<version>"             /* 5 */
  #      lts:           ["<series>","<series>"] /* 6 */
  #      archived_below:  "<version>"           /* 7 */
  #      archived_url:  "<URI>"                 /* 8 */
  #
  # 1. The project descriptor must match some contents' `project:` front matter.
  #    This should be all lowercase with underscores for spaces---code, really.
  # 2. A reader-friendly project name and an HTML-friendly project title.  
  #    Spaces and caps are welcome in the name. ex; if the `project_desc` is
  #    `riak_kv`, the `project_name` Could be `"Riak KV"`.  
  #    The HTML is expected to be wrapped in a .product__title <div> with a logo
  #    icon prepended, so only the name of the product itself should be
  #    recorded. This is a very fragile element. See below for examples.  
  #    `project_name` is required.`project_name_html` is optional.  
  #    NB. Currently the areas that this title is used are spatially small. As
  #    such the titles should be kept below ~12 characters. "DataPlatform" is
  #    the text these elements were sized with.
  # 3. The `path` is the on-disk relative path from the content root. In Hugo,
  #    the content root is '/content/', on S3 the root is simply '/'.  
  #    If the project was moved from the Middleman site to Hugo, the
  #    `archived_path` is the on-disk relative path of the previous directory.  
  #    `path` is required. `archived_path` is optional. (Or should be?)
  #    TODO: `archived_path` should probably be optional. I don't believe it
  #           currently is.
  # 4. The `releases` list-of-lists is organized oldest to newest, grouped by
  #    release set (ex. the 2.0.* series is one list, followed b the 2.1.*
  #    series).  
  #    `releases` is required. Every release must have at least one `version`.
  # 5. `latest` is the current specific version that is currently att the head-
  #    of-development.  
  #    `latest` is required.
  # 6. `lts` is the set of Release Series (ex; ["2.9"], or ["2.9","3.0"], ect.
  #    -- it is expected to be the ["X.Y"] of a semantic "X.Y.Z" version string 
  #    that is currently held as the Long Term Support series.  
  #    `lts` is optional.
  # 7. To make the versions menu smaller, set `archive_below` to a "X.Y" version
  #    to place earlier versions under a collapsed "other" item.
  #    `archive_below` is optional.
  # 8. If the project was moved from the Middleman site to Hugo, the
  #    `archived_url` is the URL to the newest of the deprecated pages.  
  #    `archived_url` is optional.
