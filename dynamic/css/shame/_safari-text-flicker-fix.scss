/**
 * An issue was observed in Safari where hovering over sub-headings -- which
 * would case a doc icon's opacity to transition from 0 to 1 -- was causing all
 * of the text in the main article to flicker. More specifically, it was losing,
 * and then regaining a certain amount of clarity.
 *
 * It turns this was caused by Safari changing the entire element from a 2D
 * object to a 3D object for the duration of the transition.
 *
 * This rule sets the entire element to a 3D object _at load time_ to prevent
 * the change from occurring. How stupid is that?
 *
 * The issue was last observed on Safari Version 10.0.3 (11602.4.8.0.1) running
 * in OS X 10.11.6 (15G1217) on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)
 * Fix found on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30637358
