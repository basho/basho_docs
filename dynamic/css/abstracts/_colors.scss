/// Basic Color Pallet
/// ==================
/// We should do our best to name all colors used here before referencing them
/// in SCSS code elsewhere. These colors were distilled from the basho.com color
/// pallet and the older Middleman documentation website.
///
/// This file is split into two parts; the first is the primary, descriptive
/// definition of the basic color palette for this site, defining common colors
/// by name, rather than by use. The second portion of this file is a more
/// semantically-focused. Colors are defined based on what they should be used
/// for, rather than by what they are. Colors in the second portion should be
/// defined as descriptive colors, or as modifications (lighten(), darken(),
/// saturate(), etc.) of descriptive colors.
///
///
/// I would like to make it very clear that the final say of colors used is
/// currently being made by someone who considers himself an engineer first, and
/// a designer third (if I'm being generous). I am happy to field any and all
/// recommendations for improvement.
///
///TODO: Transition from using descriptive colors in CSS, to using semantic
///      colors. Full disclosure, using descriptive colors makes it _way_ easier
///      to iterate so I'm probably not going to make that change until
///      final draft of the layout has been +1'd by the team.
///TODO: Once the redesign is complete, we should move back through the color
///      palette and ensure that all colors that have been defined are used (or
///      will likely be used soon). I have no interest in maintaining a color
///      set that isn't in use, and therefore drifts away form the used colors.
///
///
/// NB. We use Sass comments rather than the C-style block comments that persist
///     through the SCSS -> CSS compilation because this file **should not**
///     generate any CSS of its own. Any C-style comments would result in
///     dangling comment blocks in the compiled CSS.

// Grays (so many grays)
// ---------------------
// These grays (and yes; gray, not grey. I'm American, so that's how I'll spell
// it) were generated using ~`sass-eval rgb(n-3%, n%, n+3%)` where `n` is the
// given `gray-n`. As we move towards white, the drift will shrink to +/-2, then
// eventually +/-1.
// Warm grays have no drift, which will red-shift (warm) the color.
// $gray-38 was taken from the standard Riak logo and is `rgb(38%,38%,40%)`. It
// will remain as the brand-gray, and should be used for structural and branding
// elements (menu bars, major headings, etc.), while the rest of the site is
// pushed more towards a softened blue-gray.

// Semantic Colors
// ===============

// Basic Uses
// ----------
$font-color : $gray-30; // Default font color. Emphatically Not Black.

$shadow-light-color : rgba(0,0,0,0.1); // Less intense shadow color, for lighter elements
$shadow-color       : rgba(0,0,0,0.2); // Default shadow color for box-shadows
$shadow-mid-color   : rgba(0,0,0,0.4); // Moderately intense shadow color
$shadow-hard-color  : rgba(0,0,0,0.8); // More intense shadow color, for heavier elements
