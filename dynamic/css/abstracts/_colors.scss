/// Basic Color Pallet
/// ==================
/// We should do our best to name all colors used here before referencing them
/// in SCSS code elsewhere. These colors were distilled from the basho.com color
/// pallet and the older Middleman documentation website.
///
/// I would like to make it very clear that the final say of colors used is
/// currently being made by someone who considers himself an engineer first, and
/// a designer third (if I'm being generous). Recommendations for
/// improvement welcome!
///
/// NB. We use Sass comments rather than the C-style block comments that persist
///     through the SCSS -> CSS compilation because this file **should not**
///     generate any CSS of its own. Any C-style comments would result in
///     dangling comment blocks in the compiled CSS.
///
///TODO: Some colors below may not be in active use --- specifically,
/// $orange-light and $orange-lightest. Unused colors should be culled once the
/// CSS rework has been completed.
