Basho Data Platform (BDP) enables you to extend Riak with Spark and Redis. This page will guide you through the process of installing BDP on most supported operating systems.

> BDP is supported on a limited number of platforms. See the list of supported OSes [here][bdp compatibility].

## Prerequisites

You need to have root or sudo access on the nodes you will be installing BDP on.

## Installing

1. First, change the open-files limit.
2. If you plan to use Spark, then install Java 8.
3. Finally, install the BDP package.

### Increase The Open-Files Limit

Before you can install BDP, both the total open-files limit and the per-user open-files limit must be high enough to allow BDP to function.

For a fuller guide on changing limits for Riak, see [Changing the limit]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.1.3/using/performance/open-files-limit) .

On most Linux distributions, the total limit for open files is controlled by `sysctl`.

```bash
sudo sysctl fs.file-max fs.file-max=65536
sudo sysctl -p
```

To change the per-user file limit, you need to edit /etc/security/limits.conf.

On CentOS systems, set a proper limit for the user you’re usually logging in with to do any kind of work on the machine, including managing Riak. On CentOS, `sudo` properly inherits the values from the executing user.

On Ubuntu systems, the following settings are recommended:

```config
»USERNAME« hard nofile 65536
»USERNAME« soft nofile 65536
root hard nofile 65536
root soft nofile 65536
```

> You may need to log out of your shell and then log back in for these changes to take effect.

### Java 8

If you are using or plan to use Spark, you must install Java 8 on **each node that will run Spark services** (unless you are using Spark with Python). Installing Java works a little differently depending on whether you are running Ubuntu or CentOS.

If you are on Ubuntu, run the following to install Java 8:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common python-software-properties debconf-utils
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
# accept java license
sudo echo -e oracle-java8-installer shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 select true | sudo debconf-set-selections
sudo apt-get install -y oracle-java8-installer
```

If you are on CentOS, run the following to install Java 8:

```bash
cd /opt
sudo wget -O jdk-8.rpm --no-cookies --no-check-certificate --header "Cookie: gpw_e24=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oracle.com%2F; oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" "http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u45-b14/jdk-8u45-linux-x64.rpm"
sudo yum -y localinstall jdk-8.rpm
```

Regardless of your OS, once you have installed Java 8 you need to add a specific `JAVA_HOME` line to your /etc/environment. You can add the correct line by running:

```shell
JAVA_HOME=$(dirname $(dirname $(readlink -f $(which javac))))
grep JAVA_HOME /etc/environment >/dev/null 2>&1 || test $? -ne 0 && sudo bash -c "echo JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME >>/etc/environment"
export JAVA_HOME
```

### Install BDP

Now that you've increased your open-files limit and installed Java 8 where necessary, you're ready to install the BDP packages.

>Enterprise Note:
>If you are an Enterprise customer, make sure to download the -extras package as well. The -extras package is available alongside the regular packages in the usual Zendesk forums.

BDP open source packages for all supported operating systems are available for download on the [Download Basho Data Platform page][bdp download].

Choose the installation instructions below that match your OS.

#### Ubuntu

1. Download the packages from the [downloads][bdp download] page (or packages from Zendesk).
2. Unpack the packages using `sudo dpkg -i »package_name_here«` for each one.

#### CentOS

1. Download the packages from the [downloads][bdp download] page (or packages from Zendesk).
2. Unpack the packages using `sudo yum -y --nogpgcheck --noplugins localinstall »package_name_here«` for each one.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Basho Data Platform. Now, [set up a data platform cluster][bdp configure].
