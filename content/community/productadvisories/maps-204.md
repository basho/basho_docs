## Overview

On January 20th, 2015, a user
[reported]
issues with [Riak data types][dev data types] upon upgrading from Riak
2.0.2 to 2.0.4. It was discovered that keys storing
[Riak maps][dev data types maps] are unreadable after upgrading due to a change
in the on-disk format of maps that was introduced as a performance improvement.

## Identification

You can verify whether this issue is affecting your cluster by checking
your cluster's [logs][cluster ops log]. You will see errors along the following
lines if your cluster is affected:

```
2015-01-21 13:01:00.441 [error]
<0.1033.0>@riak_core_vnode:vnode_command:348 riak_kv_vnode command

```

## Affected Users

Users will be affected under the following conditions:

1. They use Riak maps in their cluster
1. They have upgraded to Riak version 2.0.4

If your cluster does not use Riak maps you may upgrade to 2.0.4 as
normal.

## Mitigation Strategy

The recommended mitigation strategy is to upgrade to [Riak 2.0.5 or
later][downloads].
