The adage that no documentation is better than poor quality
documentation should always be borne in mind when we write
documentation. We should strive to provide accurate and current
information in a clear and consistent style that is appropriate for the
target audience.

For the sake of delivering clear and consistent documentation, this
document provides a common set of writing guidelines, complete with
document structures, styles, and conventions that we try to follow.

## Essential Style Concepts

### Audience

Before you begin authoring a document or response, be sure to
*accurately identify your intended audience*. This should always be the
first thing you do before even outlining or typing a single word.

Once you've identified your audience, try to keep their needs in mind
when writing. Our audience fortunately consists mainly of highly
technical people, but you should still avoid excessive use of jargon and
opt to keep language clear and simple wherever possible.

### Voice

We prefer to prove that we're human by using the active voice in our
documentation and customer responses. The collective pronouns *we* or
*us* are preferred over *I* in most cases, except for when writing in
informal communication styles, such as in blog posts.

### Style for Purpose

It should always be asked of a document: is this document primarily
descriptive, prescriptive, or explanatory in nature? Our documentation
is generally split into two major document types: *guides* and
*references*. Once you've identified your audience, the next step is to
choose the type of document that you will write from these two primary
forms.

#### Guides

A **guide** helps the user through a particular process often by using
detailed and stepwise instructions presented in a narrative style.

When writing guides, it is helpful to use ordered lists when presenting
a series of steps, examples of the exact commands required to complete
those steps, and the expected output from each command.

#### References

In contrast to a guide, a **reference** is more of a collection of raw
knowledge that strives for correctness and completeness. In references,
the  focus is on compact explanation of specific features, API methods,
and similarly fine-grained domains of knowledge. It is important to
include all available information in a reference.

Guides and references are complementary documents and should always
exist in separate form. Avoid the temptation to mix the two styles in
one document.

### Consistency

Consistency is a key element in authoring technical content. Using the
same term for something every single time is very important if you seek
to avoid confusing the reader. While a concept may be well grounded in
your mind due to frequent use, communicating to a person unfamiliar with
the concept is less effective when you use terminology inconsistently.

Even minor inconsistencies, such as the addition of an extra word to a
term or an unconventional abbreviation, can confuse the reader. This
confusion will ultimately impair their ability to effectively understand
your writing and, by extension, our technologies.

## Document Design & Structure

The following pointers will help you structure a document and highlight
important content in a consistent way.

### Chunks and Scanning

Well-written documentation is organized and presented in way that plays
to our tendency to rapidly scan content and find the information we
need.

To that end, write in small, easily scanned chunks of related
information, use common, everyday vocabulary suited for the target
audience, and avoid dense paragraphs stuffed with technical terminology
whenever possible.

### Headings, Lists, & Emphasis

Proper organization and flow in a document helps the reader more quickly
locate the information they need. The following section describes
document organization methods which facilitate scanning and findability
while maintaining logical content ordering.

In general, it's a good idea to use ordered---i.e. numbered---lists to
denote stepwise operations and unordered lists for grouping related
items, and to introduce both types of list with a complete sentence that
ends in a colon (`:`).

This is a sample unordered list:

* Riak
* Riak Enterprise
* Riak CS

#### Headings

Using descriptive headings helps to summarize detailed content within a
section of documentation. This also helps the reader scan a document and
quickly locate the section of content most appropriate for their needs.

Try to describe document sections with well-worded headings, and keep
heading levels to a minimum to reduce document structure complexity.

When writing headings, use an uppercase initial letter for all nouns,
verbs, and adjectives. Use an uppercase initial letter for all
conjunctions and prepositions longer than 4 characters. Use all
lowercase letters for conjunctions and prepositions shorter than 4
characters.

When in doubt, there's a web tool that helps with correct [title
capitalization](http://titlecapitalization.com/) in headers.

##### Performance and Tuning

### Formatting Conventions

The following describes text formatting conventions useful for all
customer-facing product documentation and issue responses.

#### Italics

Use text set in *italics* to introduce new technology terminology,
provided that it is followed by a corresponding explanation. It's also
good form to italicize non-English words, *exempli gratia*.

#### Bold

Use **bold** text when describing the targets of user interface options
or locations in an interface or system, such as "click **Save**".

#### Fixed Width (Monospace)

Use `fixed-width` text by wrapping items in single backticks (\\`) to
indicate command names, code, filenames, or text strings that a user is
expected to actually type in.

Typically, bare fixed-width text will indicate the actual commands and
arguments needed. When the placeholder arguments are used in an example
and the placeholder arguments should be replaced with actual data, a
note should be made about doing so.

Example:

After modifying `vm.args`, restart the node with `riak restart`.

### Preformatted Text Blocks

Use three backticks (\\`) with an optional language designator to
indicate blocks of code, configuration data, or other preformatted text.

Trim line lengths to less than 80 characters, and don't include actual
prompts for command line examples, as doing so can be troublesome for
readers who copy and paste command line examples.

Erlang code example:

```erlang
length([P || {riak_kv_vnode, P, _} <- riak_core_vnode_manager:all_vnodes()]).
```

Shell commands example:

```bash
riak-admin member-status
riak-admin transfers
```

### Callouts & Notes

Inline notes are formatted in Markdown by wrapping text in
single-asterisk (`*`) characters.

Inline note example:

*Note that when attempting to identify the database...*

For blockstyle callouts in documentation, use an HTML `<div>` element
with either *info* or *note* classes. When using the *info* class, an
icon is included in the styling of the block for additional visual
impact. You can optionally specify a title for the block style note with
a second `<div>` element inside the note or info `<div>` with a class of
*title*.

Block note with title example:

```html
<div class="note">
<div class="title">Note on Magic Switch</div>
There is a third-party switch located on the cabinet. Please do not
change the switch setting from **more magic** to **magic** while the
machine is in production, as a crash could occur.
</div>
```

Please note that Markdown syntax can also be intermixed within the HTML
`<div>` elements as well.

### Grammar, Punctuation & Spelling

Consistent grammar, punctuation, and spelling usage within our
documentation strengthens reader confidence and helps to avoid
confusion.

#### Abbreviations

Abbreviation is the shortening of a word form. In writing about time,
for example, it is common to abbreviate *ante meridiem* as "am" and
*post meridiem* as "pm".

When using abbreviation, avoid creating new forms of abbreviation, as
this can cause confusion. It is also unnecessary to explain the meaning
of familiar abbreviations (as in the above example).

#### Acronyms

An acronym is the representation of a multi-word term and is usually
formed by taking the first letter of each word from the term,
capitalizing it, and combining it with the other letters. The acronym
for *application programming interface*, for example, is "API".

When you first use an acronym in a document, you should write out the
full term and enclose the acronym in parentheses immediately after the
term.

Avoid creating new acronyms in an ad-hoc manner, as they can cause
confusion.

Example:

This guide explains tuning Riak for operating clusters within the Amazon
Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.

#### Apostrophe

Use apostrophes primarily for making contractions. In the case of
internationalization of documentation, contractions should be avoided.
Pluralization of acronyms is *not* a correct use of apostrophes.

Example:

Don't forget that you cannot easily change the `ring_creation_size`
after it has been initially specified.

#### Articles

Avoid using the definite article "the" to begin any of the following:

* Headings
* Document titles
* Section or chapter titles
* Callouts or notes
* Figure or table captions

#### Captions

Captions do not require a period at the end and use the same general
rules as headings.

#### Comma

The comma (`,`) should be used in series fashion when using lists of
three or more items and after introductory clauses. As a rule, we use
the Oxford comma for the sake of clarity.

Example:

The memory, disk, and network utilization are graphed using Graphite.

#### Commands

Avoid using commands as verbs.

#### Colon

Use a colon to introduce sequences or steps in a process or when a
command line example is to be shown. Colons should not, however, be used
in headings.

Example:

Follow these steps on each node to modify the configuration:

1. Stop the node.
2. Update the `app.config` file.
3. Verify the configuration with `riak chkconfig`.
4. If the configuration is valid, start the node with `riak start`.

#### Hyphen

Hyphens are common in technical documentation, but they are also tricky
to use properly. Fundamentally, a hyphen should join two words to form a
single concept, but there are other uses for hyphens as well, such as
denoting fractional measurements.

Examples:

* two-phase commit
* decision-making tree
* time-sensitive data

When in doubt about correct hyphen usage, consult a
[[reference|Documentation Style Guide#References]].

#### Key Names

All keyboard key names should be capitalized and bolded.

Example:

Press **Control**+**Alt**+**Delete** to reboot.

#### Numbers and Numerals

Since this is technical documentation, the normal rules of spelling
small numbers don't apply all that much. Most of our usage of numbers
are for precision. We'd rather see the sentence:

"You should aim for 8 vnodes per node."

As opposed to the wordy variant:

"You should aim for eight vnodes per node."

Try and avoid starting sentences with numbers.

Examples:

* An 8-core processor
* Roughly 7 million operations per second
* The output consisted of four 25MB log files

#### Parentheses

Use parentheses to encapsulate acronyms on first use and for alternative
terms, but do not use them for complete asides or additional explanatory
text. Parentheses are also useful for referencing a specific section of
a system manual page.

Examples:

* Read about tuning the ZFS Second-Level Adaptive Replacement Cache
  (L2ARC)
* See the sysctl(8) manual page for more details

#### Period

The period (`.`) is used to end complete sentences, at the end of each
step in a stepwise procedure, and in certain circumstances like acronyms
and abbreviations.

Example:

Complete steps 4 through 9 for each node that is a cluster member.

#### Proper Names

Proper names, such as *Java*, *Python*, *Ruby*, and *Justin* should
always be capitalized, with the exception of referring to commands of
the same name, as in the case of `java`, `python`, and `ruby`.

Example:

Justin typed `python` and pressed **Enter** to start the Python
interactive interpreter.

#### Quotations

Use quotations for emphasizing text from other sources when used
verbatim. We prefer quotations in web documents to underlining as an
alternate emphasis method beyond bold or italics.

Example:

"Yes, it can silently fail if you don't check the returned error code."

#### Blockquotes

For multiple sentence quotes, consider a blockquote, which is a line
started with a less than (>) character.

Example:

> To achieve this level of availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency
under certain failure scenarios. It makes extensive use of object
versioning and application-assisted conflict resolution in a manner that
provides a novel interface for developers to use.

#### Semicolons

Some people like semicolons, but they can be tricky to use. We recommend
avoiding them; unless you really paid attention in English class.

#### Dashes

Unlike semicolons, dashes are hard to use incorrectly. But their overuse
can make copy harder to read---use sparingly to separate ideas. You can
create a proper [em dash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Em_dash) in
markdown by typing three [en
dashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#En_dash) (`---`).

## Terminology

A number of technical terms related to distributed computing
environments and specific to Riak are common to our product
documentation. Consistent use of these terms is critical to composing
accurate documentation that inspires confidence.


### Basho Product-Specific Terminology

#### Erlang

*Erlang* is the primary programming language used to develop Riak and
Riak-related products. It should always be capitalized, as there is no
`erlang` command.

#### Fullsync, realtime

When describing Riak Enterprise replication, eschew hyphens in
*fullsync* and *realtime*.

#### MapReduce

*MapReduce* is written as "MapReduce;" avoid the use of incorrect
versions of the term, such as "Map/Reduce", "M/R", or any
lowercase-only form (e.g., "mapreduce").

#### Multi-Datacenter Replication

One of the features of Riak Enterprise is Multi-Datacenter Replication.
It should be capitalized in both headings and sentences.

#### Protocol Buffers

When referring to the Google *Protocol Buffers* data serialization
mechanism, refer to it as "Protocol Buffers" or "protocol buffers."
Avoid using project name abbreviations like "protobuffs."

When writing about the Riak Protocol Buffers Client or API, use of the
abbreviation "PBC" or "PBC API" is acceptable, provided that the full
term is introduced at an earlier point in the document or response.

#### Riak

*Riak* is a product name and should always be spelled with a capital
R.

On the other hand, `riak` is a command name, is case-sensitive, and
should always be spelled in all lowercase letters and enclosed in
backticks when using Markdown.

#### Riak Enterprise

*Riak Enterprise* is a product name. Avoid references to "Riak EE,"
"Riak EDS," or just "Enterprise".

### Localized Date Conventions

Should use the date convention for the document audience and avoid
abbreviations in date components, such as month names. Time should be
expressed in 24-hour format with a note about the specific time zone in
use. If in doubt, use ISO 8601: `YYYY-MM-DD`.
