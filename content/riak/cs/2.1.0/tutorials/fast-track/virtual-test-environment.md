This option for building an environment uses a Vagrant project powered
by Chef to bring up a local Riak CS cluster. Each node can run either
Ubuntu 12.04 or CentOS 6.5 64-bit with 1536MB of RAM by default. If you
want to tune the OS or node/memory count, you'll have to edit the
`Vagrantfile` directly.

If you want to build a testing environment with more flexibility in
configuration and durability across environment resets, there are
instructions for [Building a Local Test Environment]({{<baseurl>}}riak/cs/2.1.0/tutorials/fast-track/local-testing-environment).

## Configuration

### Install Prerequisites

* Download and install VirtualBox from [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
* Download and install Vagrant via the [Vagrant Installer](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/).

**Note**: Please make sure to install Vagrant 1.1.0 and above.

### Install Vagrant plugins

Install the following Vagrant plugins:

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier # Use RIAK_CS_USE_CACHE to enable
```

### Clone the Repository

In order to begin, it is necessary to clone a GitHub repository to your
local machine and change directories into the cloned folder.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/basho/vagrant-riak-cs-cluster
cd vagrant-riak-cs-cluster
```

### Launch Cluster

With VirtualBox and Vagrant installed, it's time to launch our virtual
environment. The command below will initiate the Vagrant project:

``` bash
RIAK_CS_CREATE_ADMIN_USER=1 vagrant up
```

If you haven't already downloaded the Ubuntu or CentOS Vagrant box, this
step will download it.

### Recording Admin User credentials

In the Chef provisioning output, you will see entries that look like
this:

```log
[2013-03-27T11:59:12+00:00] INFO: Riak CS Key: 5N2STDSXNV-US8BWF1TH
[2013-03-27T11:59:12+00:00] INFO: Riak CS Secret: RF7WD0b3RjfMK2cTaPfLkpZGbPDaeALDtqHeMw==
```

Take note of these keys as they will be required in the testing step.

In this case, those keys are:

```config
Access key: 5N2STDSXNV-US8BWF1TH
Secret key: RF7WD0b3RjfMK2cTaPfLkpZGbPDaeALDtqHeMw==
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have deployed a virtualized environment of Riak CS.
You are ready to progress to [Testing the Riak CS Installation]({{<baseurl>}}riak/cs/2.1.0/tutorials/fast-track/test-installation).

### Stopping Your Virtual Environment

When you are done testing or simply want to start again from scratch,
you can end the current virtualized environment:

```bash
vagrant destroy
```

**Note**: Executing this command will reset the environment to a clean
state, removing any and all changes that you have committed.
