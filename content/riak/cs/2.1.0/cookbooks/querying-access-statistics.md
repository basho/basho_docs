Access statistics are tracked on a per-user basis as rollups for slices
of time. Querying these statistics is done via the
`/riak-cs/usage/$USER_KEY_ID` resource.

{{% note title="Note on terminology" %}}
In this and other documents in the Riak CS documentation, the terms "storage"
and "billing" are used interchangeably. The same goes for the terms "usage"
and access.
{{% /note %}}

For information about how access statistics are logged, please read
[Usage and Billing Data]({{<baseurl>}}riak/cs/2.1.0/cookbooks/usage-and-billing-data).

The following sections discuss accessing the access statistics using
bare HTTP requests. Query parameters are used to specify the types and
date ranges of information to include. For information on using `s3cmd`
(or other tools) to fetch statistics as S3 objects, skip to the [The Magic `usage` Bucket](#the-magic-usage-bucket) section.

The examples on this page assume that the `admin_port` has not
been configured to something other than default CS port of `8080`.

## Choosing the Result Format

Results are available as either JSON or XML. Request the appropriate
format by using the HTTP `Accept` header with either `application/json`
or `application/xml`, respectively.

## Specifying the User

Access statistics are provided on a per-user basis. Specify which user's
statistics you want by providing that user's `key_id` in the URL. For
example, to get access statistics for the user key
`8NK4FH2SGKJJM8JIP2GU`, use the URL
`/riak-cs/usage/8NK4FH2SGKJJM8JIP2GU`.

**Note**: The new user id generator should not include non-URL-safe
    characters, but if it does, those characters will need to be escaped
    in this URL.

A `404` code with an error message body will be returned if the user
does not exist. For example, there is no `ASDF` user in my cluster, so
fetching `http://localhost:8080/riak-cs/usage/ASDF` produces the
following JSON/XML (reformatted for easy reading):

```json
HTTP/1.1 404 Object Not Found

{
  "Error": {
    "Message":"Unknown user"
  }
}
```

```xml
HTTP/1.1 404 Object Not Found

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <Error>
    <Message>Unknown user</Message>
  </Error>
```

## Enable Access Results

> **Authentication Required**
>
> Queries to the usage resources described here must be authenticated as
described in the [Authentication documentation]({{<baseurl>}}riak/cs/2.1.0/cookbooks/authentication). Keep this in mind when using `curl`. Authentication credentials for `s3cmd` or `s3-curl` can be specified in their respective configuration files.

The usage HTTP resource provides both access and storage statistics.
Since each of these queries can be taxing in its own right, they are
both omitted from the result by default:

```curl
curl http://localhost:8080/riak-cs/usage/8NK4FH2SGKJJM8JIP2GU
```

Sample responses (reformatted for easy reading):

```json
{
  "Access" :"not_requested",
  "Storage":"not_requested"
}
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <Usage>
    <Access>not_requested</Access>
    <Storage>not_requested</Storage>
  </Usage>
```

To request that access results be included, pass the query parameter `a`
to the resource (any true-ish value will work, including just the bare
`a`, `t`, `true`, `1`, `y`, and `yes`):

```curl
curl http://localhost:8080/riak-cs/usage/8NK4FH2SGKJJM8JIP2GU?a
```

Sample responses (reformatted for easy reading):

```json
{
  "Access": [
    { "Errors": [] }
  ],
  "Storage": "not_requested"
}
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <Usage>
    <Access>
      <Errors/>
    </Access>
    <Storage>not_requested</Storage>
  </Usage>
```

There are no statistics included in this report because the default time
span is *now*, which is not available in the archives.

## Specifying the Time Span to Report

Request the time span you want data for by passing `s` (start) and `e`
(end) query parameters to the resource. The slices for which data will
be returned are all of those between `s` and `e`, as well as the slice
including `s` and the slice including `e`.

For example, for slices `A`-`I`:

       A     B     C     D     E     F     G     H     I
    |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
                   s                 e

Specifying an `s` that falls somewhere in slice `C` and an `e` that
falls somewhere in slice `F` means that data for slices `C`, `D`, `E`,
and `F` will be returned.

Each should be provided in ISO 8601 format (`yyyymmddThhmmssZ`). For
example, the following values would request the span between 2:00pm and
4:00pm (GMT) on January 30, 2012:

```curl
http://localhost:8080/riak-cs/usage/8NK4FH2SGKJJM8JIP2GU?a&s=20120315T140000Z&e=20120315T160000Z
```

    {
      "Node": "riak_cs@127.0.0.1",
      "Samples": [

    }
  ],

}

        <Sample StartTime="20120315T150000Z" EndTime="20120315T152931Z">
          <Operation type="KeyWrite">

          </Operation>
          <Operation type="KeyRead">

  </Usage>
```

The behavior of the resource when the `s` or `e` parameter is omitted
may change, but is currently as follows:

* Omitting `e` will cause the resource to return only data for the slice
  in which `s` falls
* Omitting `s` will cause the resource to return data for all slices
  from `e` through the current time

Or, more simply, the default `s` is *now* and the default `e` is equal
to `s`.

### Time Span Limit

To prevent excessive time and memory from being accidentally consumed,
the amount of time that may be retrieved in any request is limited.

The limit is configured by the `riak_cs` application environment
variable `usage_request_limit`. The value is expressed as an integer
number of archive intervals (see [Usage and Billing Data]({{<baseurl>}}riak/cs/2.1.0/cookbooks/usage-and-billing-data) for a
description of archive intervals).

The default value is `744`, which is 31 days at the default archive
interval of one hour.

## The Magic `usage` Bucket

If you would prefer to use `s3cmd` or another S3 library to fetch access
stats, you may do so by referencing objects in the global `usage`
bucket. The format for objects in the usage bucket is:

```bash
s3://riak-cs/usage/UserKeyId/Options/StartTime/EndTime
```

Or, if `/` is automatically quoted (`%2f`) by your client, the `.`
character may be used (this is also nicer for s3cmd, since it will
automatically choose a more useful name for the file it creates):

```bash
s3://riak-cs/usage/UserKeyId.Options.StartTime.EndTime
```

That is, in the usage bucket, this is a sub-bucket named for the user's
`key_id` (the `UserKeyId` part of the path).

Inside the user's bucket is a sub-bucket named for the contents and
their representation (the `Options` part of the path). This portion
should be:

* `aj` to receive access statistics as JSON data
* `ax` to receive access statistics as XML data

The next two portions of the path, `StartTime` and `EndTime`, are the
start and end times for the window to report, respectively. These take
the same ISO 8601 format that the `s` and `e` query parameters take in
the other request method.

As an example, making the same request as the last example, for
JSON-format access statistics between 2:00pm and 4:00pm GMT on January
30, 2012, looks like this:

```bash
s3cmd get s3://riak-cs/usage/8NK4FH2SGKJJM8JIP2GU/aj/20120315T140000Z/20120315T160000Z
```

**Note**: All objects in the `usage` bucket are read-only. `PUT` and
`DELETE` requests will fail for them.

**Note**: Regular users are only allowed to access the statistics bucket
for their own `key_id`. The admin user is allowed to access any stat
bucket.

## Interpreting the Results

Results of the access query are grouped by node. That is, within the
access field of the result will be one entry for each Riak CS node that
had data for the requested time span.

Each node entry will contain one or more "samples" for each time slice
that the user accessed that Riak CS node. The sample will have a start
time and end time describing what span the sample covers.

The other entries of each sample are the operations the user performed
during the sampled time. Operation statistics are provided as rollups
for each operation type. The rollup includes one or more of the
following fields:

* `Count` --- the number of times this operation was used successfully
* `UserErrorCount` --- the number of times this operation was used but
  ended in a 400-499 response code
* `SystemErrorCount` --- the number of times this operation was used but
  ended in a 500-599 response code
* `BytesIn` --- the number of bytes that were included in the request
  bodies of successful operations
* `UserErrorBytesIn` --- the number of bytes that were included in the
  request bodies of operations that ended in 400-499 response codes
* `SystemErrorBytesIn` --- the number of bytes that were included in the
  request bodies of operations that ended in 500-599 response codes
* `BytesOut` --- the number of bytes that were included in the response
  bodies of successful operations
* `UserErrorBytesOut` --- the number of bytes that were included in the
  response bodies of operations that ended in 400-499 response codes
* `SystemErrorBytesOut` --- the number of bytes that were included in
  the response bodies of operations that ended in 500-599 response codes
* `BytesOutIncomplete` --- the number of bytes that were sent in
  response bodies before the client disconnected, if there was more that
  could have been sent afterward (i.e. the byte count of partial
  downloads)

It is important to note that accesses are only logged when the
Webmachine request finishes. This means that, for example, an upload
started in one time slice but ended in another will only add to the
`bytes in` field for the time slice in which in finished, rather than
splitting the statistics between the slices in which they actually
happened.

### Operation Types

The operation types that are currently tracked are the following:

Operation | Description
:---------|:-----------
`ListBuckets` | Lists a user's buckets (`GET /`)
`UsageRead` | Reads a user's usage statistics (`GET /riak-cs/usage/user/*`)
`BucketRead` | Lists the files in a bucket (`GET /bucket`)
`BucketStat` | Checks for the existence of a bucket (`HEAD /bucket`)
`BucketCreate` | Creates a bucket (`PUT /bucket`)
`BucketDelete` | Deletes a bucket (`DELETE /bucket`)
`BucketUnknown` | Unknown bucket operation (`?? /bucket`)
`BucketReadACL` | Retrieves the ACL of a bucket (`GET /bucket?acl`)
`BucketStatACL` | Checks for the existence of a bucket (`HEAD /bucket?acl`)
`BucketWriteACL` | Changes the ACL of a bucket (`PUT /bucket?acl`)
`BucketUnknownACL` | Unknown bucket ACL operation (`?? /bucket?acl`)
`KeyRead` | Fetches an object (`GET /bucket/key`)
`KeyStat` | Checks for the existence of an object (`HEAD /bucket/key`)
`KeyWrite` | Uploads an object (`PUT /bucket/key`)
`KeyDelete` | Deletes an object (`DELETE /bucket/key`)
`KeyUnknown` | Unknown object operation (`?? /bucket/key`)
`KeyReadACL` | Retrieves the ACL of a key (`GET /bucket/key?acl`)
`KeyStatACL` | Checks for the existence of an object (`HEAD /bucket/key?acl`)
`KeyWriteACL` | Changes the ACL of an object (`PUT /bucket/key?acl`)
`KeyUnknownACL` | Unknown key ACL operation (`?? /bucket/key?acl`)
`UnknownGET` | A `GET` was issued on an unrecognized resource, which likely means that the `riak_cs_access_logger:operation/1` function is out of date
`UnknownHEAD` | See `UnknownGET`
`UnknownPUT` | See `UnknownGET`
`UnknownPOST` | See `UnknownGET`
`UnknownDELETE` | See `UnknownGET`

### Lookup Errors

In addition to the node entries in the access results, there is also an
entry for errors that Riak CS encountered while fetching access
archives. The errors list is very similar to the samples of a node list:
each entry will contain the start and end times of the period, as well
as the "reason" the lookup failed.

For example, if the Riak lookups that Riak CS uses end in timeout
instead of success, the result including an errors list might look like
the following (reformatted for easy reading):

```json
{
  "Access": [
    {
      "Errors": [
        {
          "StartTime": "20120315T160000Z",
          "EndTime": "20120315T170000Z",
          "Reason": "timeout"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Storage": "not_requested"
}
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <Usage>
    <Access>
      <Errors>
        <Sample StartTime="20120315T160000Z" EndTime="20120315T170000Z">
          <Reason>timeout</Reason>
        </Sample>
      </Errors>
    </Access>
    <Storage>not_requested</Storage>
  </Usage>
```
