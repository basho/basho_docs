This page introduces the architecture behind Riak CS. If you already
know this, you can skip it and progress to [Building a Local Test Environment](../local-testing-environment) or [Building a Virtual Testing Environment](../virtual-test-environment).

## Architecture

Riak CS is built on Riak. When an object is uploaded, Riak CS breaks the
object into smaller blocks that are streamed, stored, and replicated in
the underlying Riak cluster. Each block is associated with metadata for
retrieval. Since data is replicated, and other nodes automatically take
over responsibilities of nodes that go down, data remains available even
in failure conditions.

### How It Works

In a Riak CS system, any node can respond to client requests - there is
no master node and each node has the same responsibilities. Since data
is replicated (three replicas per object by default), and other nodes
automatically take over the responsibility of failed or
non-communicative nodes, data remains available even in the event of
node failure or network partition.

When an object is uploaded via the [storage API]({{<baseurl>}}riak/cs/2.0.0/references/apis/storage), Riak CS breaks the object into smaller chunks that are streamed,
written, and replicated in Riak. Each chunk is associated with metadata
for later retrieval. The diagram below provides a visualization.

## Riak CS Enterprise

Riak CS Enterprise extends Riak CS with Multi-Datacenter Replication,
monitoring, and 24Ã—7 support. Customers use Multi-Datacenter Replication
to serve global traffic, create availability zones, maintain active
backups, or meet disaster recovery and regulatory requirements.
Multi-Datacenter Replication can be used in two or more sites. Data can
be replicated across data centers using realtime or fullsync
replication. To try out Riak CS Enterprise, sign up for a [developer trial](http://info.basho.com/RiakCS1.1_DeveloperTrialRequest.html).
