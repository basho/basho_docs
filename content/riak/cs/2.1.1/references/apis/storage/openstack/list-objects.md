## Requests

### Request Syntax

```http
GET /<api version>/<account>/<container> HTTP/1.1

## Responses

A list of objects is returned in the response body, one object name
per line. The response will be a `200 OK` if the request succeeded. If
the container does not exist, or if an incorrect account is specified,
then a response with a `404` (Not Found) status code will be returned.
