This page exists solely to redirect from the generated URL to the above `target`

We prefer to store these redirects as .html files in static/ but -- for reasons
yet divined -- Hugo replaces public/riak/index.html with an empty file some time
after it is sync'd from static/ but before the dynamic/ content is done being
compiled.
