Riak TS can be installed on CentOS-based systems using a binary
package available through ZenDesk.

Check your email for the link to the download in ZenDesk.

>**Note on SELinux**
>
>CentOS enables SELinux by default, so you may need to disable SELinux if
you encounter errors.


## Install Riak TS

### For CentOS 6 / RHEL 6

Once you've downloaded the package from ZenDesk, you can install the package using `yum`:

```bash
sudo yum install riak-ts-1.0.0-1.el6.centos.x86_64.rpm
```

Or manually:

```bash
sudo rpm -Uvh riak-ts-{{VERSION}}-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
```


### For CentOS 7 / RHEL 7

Once you've downloaded the package from ZenDesk, you can install the package using `yum`:

```bash
sudo yum install riak-ts-1.0.0-1.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm
```

Or manually:

```bash
sudo rpm -Uvh riak-ts-{{VERSION}}-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

## Verify your installation

You can verify that Riak TS is successfully installed by running:
