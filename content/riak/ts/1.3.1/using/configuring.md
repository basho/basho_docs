Riak TS exposes a few configuration settings via `riak.conf`. Make certain the configuration file on each node gets the same parameters to avoid inconsistent behavior.

Benchmarking of your use cases and traffic load is recommended when changing these parameters. Settings which are too permissive can result in a slow database under heavy load.

## Configuration options

### Timeout

Use `timeseries_query_timeout_ms` to configure the timeout (in milliseconds) for queries, after which a timeout error is returned. The default is 10000.

```riak.conf
timeseries_query_timeout_ms = 10000
```

### Maximum quanta

Use `timeseries_query_max_quanta_span` to configure the maximum number of quanta that a query can span. The default is 5.

```
timeseries_query_max_quanta_span = 5
```

You should set this parameter to be one more than your desired timespan, else a fraction of your queries will fall outside your `timeseries_query_max_quanta_span` window. In general, your timespan won't be an integer multiple of the quantum, so if your maximum size query is dtmax, and your quantum size is Q, then we recommend:
max_quanta = ceil(dtmax / Q + 1.0).

If a query has a larger time span than your specified maximum, the error `too_many_subqueries` will show and the query will not run. This option is intended to prevent excessively long-running queries that could affect the performance of the cluster.

The maximum allowable value is 256.

### Maximum queries

Use `timeseries_max_concurrent_queries` to set the maximum number of queries that can run concurrently per node. The default is 3. The total number of queries that can be run on a cluster is the number of nodes multiplied by the `timeseries_max_concurrent_queries` value. This constraint is to prevent an unbounded number of queries overloading the cluster.

```
timeseries_max_concurrent_queries = 3
```
