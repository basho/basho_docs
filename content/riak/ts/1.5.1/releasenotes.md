Released January 24, 2017.

Riak TS 1.5.1 is a bug fix release of TS 1.5.0. You can read the full release notes for 1.5.0 [below](#ts-1-5-0).

## Changes

* `CREATE TABLE` now waits for cluster metadata to propagate to all nodes before activating the table, which makes it ready for queries once the command is completed. [[PR 1577](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1577)]
* Query filters are now used in start/end key. With this change, filters on the local key are put into the start/end keys to reduce the range that eLevelDB has to cover. [[PR 1594](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1594)]

## Bugfixes

* [[PR 1581](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1581 )] A WHERE clause filtered on the quantum column, that used the = operator, would sometimes return a `Neither upper or lower time bounds were specified in the query` error.
* [[PR 1583](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1583 )] The configuration property name for the maximum number of quanta allowed in a query was initially using the incorrect key and overriding configured values. This removes the 1000 cap on quanta size.
* [[PR 1590](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1590 )] Fix for queries not returning results for tables using `DESC` on the local key, which could occur under some table schemas.

## TS 1.5.0

Released December 20, 2016.

Riak TS 1.5.1 expands its SQL implementation. It includes additional SELECT query clauses: `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`. It also includes `DELETE` for a single record. TS 1.5 also includes `ASC` and `DESC` keywords in table schema definition, and better usage of the `NULL` keyword in `WHERE` clause conditions and INSERT statements.

TS 1.5.1 adds `SHOW CREATE TABLE` to review the SQL statement used to create the table. This statement is useful for re-creating your table from a testing to a deployment cluster, or to another data-center.

Data storage of unstructured (binary) or opaque (JSON) data has also gotten a little easier in TS 1.5 with the introduction of a BLOB data type.

Updates in TS 1.5 include multi-line paste functionality, built-in help for SQL commands, and enhanced error handling in riak shell.

Riak TS has significantly improved performance, thanks to streamlining of the on-disk encoding format and increased parallelization of record decoding. These updates have focused on improvement of SQL query latency, and result in typical speedups of 2-4x for large queries, particularly for data sets that are distributed around the cluster.

## New Features

* `ASC` and `DESC` have been added to the CREATE TABLE statement. Adding the ASC/DESC keywords to your local key during `CREATE TABLE` means you can have your data pre-sorted in ascending or descending order as it's input into your TS table. You can read more about `ASC`/`DESC` in the local key [here]({{<baseurl>}}riak/ts/1.5.1/using/planning).

    * [[riak_test PR 1152](https://github.com/basho/riak_test/pull/1152)]

    * [[riak_shell PR 60](https://github.com/basho/riak_shell/pull/60)]
    * [[riak_shell PR 58](https://github.com/basho/riak_shell/pull/58)]

## Additions

* The timestamp type is now able to be used as an argument in aggregate functions. [[riak_ql PR 146](https://github.com/basho/riak_ql/pull/146) & [riak_ql PR 147](https://github.com/basho/riak_ql/pull/147)]
* You can now see the Status field of your TS table when you use `SHOW TABLES`. [[PR 1514](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1514 ) and
[PR 1176](https://github.com/basho/riak_test/pull/1176 )]
* Introduced the following new parameters in riak.conf. See the [TS configuration docs]({{<baseurl>}}riak/ts/1.5.1/configuring/riakconf) for details. [[PR 1505](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1505)]
    * riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_returned_data_size
    * riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_running_fsms
    * riak_kv.query.timeseries.qbuf_root_path
    * riak_kv.query.timeseries.maximum_query_queue_length

## Changes

* Object size limitations, as set in riak.conf, have been decreased. `object.size.warning_threshold` has been decreased from a default of 5MB to 50kB. `object.size.maximum` has been decreased from 50MB to 500kB. [[PR 1505](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1505) & [PR 1218](https://github.com/basho/riak_test/pull/1218/ )]
* If a bucket type property contains a `ddl` property we infer that it's a time series table. New defaults have been also been added in the event they are not specified. [[riak_core PR 870](https://github.com/basho/riak_core/pull/870)]
* The maximum number of index FSMs used to serve TS queries is now configurable. [[PR 1550](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1550)]
* Write-once conflict resolution has been changed to be more predictable. It is now based on timestamp rather than SHA-1 hash on value part. [[PR 1512](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1512)]
* LevelDB has been updated to version 2.0.33 [[eleveldb PR 231](https://github.com/basho/eleveldb/pull/231)]
* LZ4 is now the default compression for LevelDB. [[leveldb PR 164](https://github.com/basho/leveldb/pull/164) & [eleveldb PR 208](https://github.com/basho/eleveldb/pull/208)]
* Updated the default value for `riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_quanta_span`. See the [TS configuration docs]({{<baseurl>}}riak/ts/1.5.1/configuring/riakconf) for details. **Note:** due to a bug in the code, the `max_quanta_span` is capped at 1000. [[PR 1505](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1505)]
* The default value for `OFFSET` is `[ ]`. [[PR 1546](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1546)]

## Bugfixes

* [[Issue 1418](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/issues/1418)/[PR 1544](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1544) & [PR 1204](https://github.com/basho/riak_test/pull/1204 )] A bad error atom type was causing the protobuf and TTB services to crash. Error reporting for overload and other types of error conditions have been added.
* [[riak_shell Issue 33](https://github.com/basho/riak_shell/issues/33)/[riak_shell PR 59](https://github.com/basho/riak_shell/pull/59)] When unknown crashes occurred server-side, riak shell would get the report and crash itsef. Now, riak shell does not crash upon receiving unknown server-side crashes, and instead prompts you to report the bug to Basho.
* [[riak_shell PR 68](https://github.com/basho/riak_shell/pull/68), [riak_shell PR 70](https://github.com/basho/riak_shell/pull/70), & [PR 1239](https://github.com/basho/riak_test/pull/1239 )] Unicode in SQL could crash riak shell.
* [[riak_ql PR 148](https://github.com/basho/riak_ql/pull/148)] It was possible to create a Riak TS table without a local key. Doing so would result in the local key becoming an exact copy of the partition key, meaning the quantum would be listed in-full rather than in a plain field name. This caused many breaks and bugs. The local key is now required, and a table creation will be unsuccessful without it.
* [[PR 1479](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1479)] The length of the queue was supposed to be configurable, but was being overridden by supervisor. The queue is now actually configurable.
* [[PR 1478](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1478)] A rare error in the EXPLAIN statement was caused by a function_clause error in `riak_pb_ts_codec:encode_field_type/1` due to a typo in the code. The typo has been fixed.
* [[Issue 1472](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/issues/1472)/[PR 1474](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1474)] The error message has been improved when selecting an empty time range.
* [[PR 1516](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1516)] The equality operator was not working correctly with timestamp. The timestamp can now be queried using equality operators.
* [[PR 1545](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/1545 ) & [riak_test PR 1208](https://github.com/basho/riak_test/pull/1208)] Attempting to insert data into a non-existant table would cause crash.
* [[PR 1130](https://github.com/basho/riak_ql/pull/148 )] It was possible to create a table without specifying a local key - the primary key would be copied over. This led to strange tables with no valid use. This now correctly returns an error.
* [[PR 1286](https://github.com/basho/riak_ql/pull/147/files )] Aggregation functions like MAX, MIN etc would cast timestamps to sint64 by default. They now correctly return values of type timestamp which appear correctly as times in riak-shell.
* [[PR 157](https://github.com/basho/riak_ql/pull/157 ) & [PR 1206](https://github.com/basho/riak_test/pull/1206 )] SQL insert statements of the form INSERT INTO mytable (field1, field2, field3) VALUES(val1, val2, val3) were buggy.
