Riak TS exposes a few configuration settings in riak.conf. This document will walk you through the TS configurations.

You can locate your riak.conf in  /etc/riak or /usr/local/etc if you installed using one of our packages, or in /etc if you installed from source.

{{% note title="Deprecation Warning" %}}
The Riak TS configuration settings in riak.conf have changed. The old settings will be deprecated. Please update your riak.conf with the new settings.
{{% /note %}}

## Configuration options

Make certain the configuration file on each node gets the same parameters to avoid inconsistent behavior.

Benchmarking of your use cases and traffic load is recommended when changing these parameters. Settings that are too permissive can result in a slow database under heavy load.

### Query timeout

`riak_kv.query.timeseries.timeout`: the timeout for queries, after which a timeout error is returned. Default is 10s.

```riak.conf
riak_kv.query.timeseries.timeout = 10s
```

The supported units for a duration are:

- Milliseconds - `ms`
- Seconds - `s`
- Minutes - `m`
- Hours - `h`
- Days - `d`
- Weeks - `w`
- Fortnight - `f`

You can also combine units. For example, setting timeout to 3 minutes and 14 seconds:

```riak.conf
riak_kv.query.timeseries.timeout = 3m14s
```

If no unit is added, `riak_kv.query.timeseries.timeout` will be read in milliseconds:

```riak.conf
riak_kv.query.timeseries.timeout = 10000
```

*This setting was formerly `timeseries_query_timeout_ms`, please update accordingly.*

### Maximum query queues

`riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_concurrent_queries`: the maximum number of query queues that can run concurrently per node (each queue serving one query). Default is 3.

The total number of queries that can be run on a cluster is the number of nodes multiplied by the `max_concurrent_queries` value. This constraint is to prevent an unbounded number of queries overloading the cluster.

```riak.conf
riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_concurrent_queries = 3
```

*This setting was formerly `timeseries_max_concurrent_queries`, please update accordingly.*

### Maximum query queue length

`riak_kv.query.maximum_query_queue_length`: the query queue length. Default is 15.

Increase the queue length to avoid refusing queries, at the expense of higher latencies.

```riak.conf
riak_kv.query.timeseries.maximum_query_queue_length = 15
```

### Maximum quanta

`riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_quanta_span`: the maximum number of quanta that a query can span. Default is 5000, maximum 10000.

```riak.conf
riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_quanta_span = 5000
```

{{% note %}}
`riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_quanta_span` was originally designed to protect against data overload in queries. We have switched to a running estimation of projected query size to determine whether the query results can be safely returned to the client (see [`max_returned_data_size`](#maximum-returned-data-size) below).  The `max_quanta_span` still determines how many quanta a query can span, but is no longer the limiting factor in how much data a query may return.
{{% /note %}}

*This setting was formerly `timeseries_query_max_quanta_span`, please update accordingly.*

### Maximum returned data size

`riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_returned_data_size`: largest estimated size, in bytes, of the data a query can return to the client. Default value is 10000000 (10 million). If a query will exceed this value, the query will be cancelled.

When a query is broken down into per-quantum subqueries, all subqueries are queued for execution. Starting from the arrival of the second result set, we estimate the projected query result size as:

* `TotalQuerySize = AverageSubqueryResultSize * NumberOfSubqueries`, for regular queries without a LIMIT or ORDER BY clause;
* `TotalQuerySize = AverageSubqueryResultSize * LimitValue`, for queries with a LIMIT or ORDER BY clause.

If the total size is found to exceed `max_returned_data_size`, the query is cancelled, with an error code 1022 ("Projected result of a SELECT query is too big").

```riak.conf
riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_returned_data_size = 10*1000*1000
```

### Maximum subqueries

`riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_running_fsms`: throttle the number of simultaneously running FSMs (i.e. processes collecting data for a single subquery). Default is 20.

`max_running_fsms * maximum size of data chunks` will determine the maximum volume of data the coordinator will have to deal with at any given time.

Increasing this parameter allows for faster execution of queries over many small quanta. Conversely, if your quanta are large, it may be advisable to limit the number of concurrent FSMs even further, depending on the expected size of data per quantum.

{{% note %}}
Setting `max_running_fsms` to 1 will effectively disable parallel collection of subquery results. As a side effect, projected query size estimation will become deterministic, where subqueries will be processed from first to last, one at a time.
{{% /note %}}

```riak.conf
riak_kv.query.timeseries.max_running_fsms = 20
```

### Object Size Limits

`riak_kv.object.size.warning_threshold`, `riak_kv.object.size.maximum`: object size limits. Defaults are 50K and 500K, respectively.

Note that Riak TS default configuration now has smaller object sizes in order to improve performance.

```riak.conf
riak_kv.object.size.warning_threshold = 50K
riak_kv.object.size.maximum = 500K
```

### Query buffers root path

`riak_kv.query.timeseries.qbuf_root_path`: Root path for LevelDB instances backing node-local query buffers. Default is "$(platform_data_dir)/query_buffers".

For queries with an ORDER BY clause and/or LIMIT or OFFSET keywords, a separate, slower code path will be used whereby data collected from vnodes will be stored in temporary *query buffers*. Each query buffer is a disk-backed LevelDB table, created as a subdirectory under `timeseries.qbuf_root_path`, which will be deleted after the query is served.

{{% note %}}
1. Placing the root path on a fast media, such as a dedicated SSD or a RAM-based disk such as `/tmp`, is recommended.

2. The contents of this directory will be deleted at node startup and shutdown. If you choose to specify a path outside of `$(platform_data_dir)`, make sure no other process reads or writes to it.
{{% /note %}}

```riak.conf
riak_kv.query.timeseries.qbuf_root_path = "$(platform_data_dir)/query_buffers"
```

Further documentation about these settings can be found at [Riak object settings].

### Settings to be ignored

The following settings show up in riak.conf but should not be changed:

* `riak_kv.query.timeseries.qbuf_soft_watermark`
* `riak_kv.query.timeseries.qbuf_hard_watermark`
* `riak_kv.query.timeseries.qbuf_expire_ms`
* `riak_kv.query.timeseries.qbuf_incomplete_release_ms`
