This document will cover the API calls for accessing Riak TS data over HTTP.


## Overview

All Riak TS calls use the '/ts' endpoint. Using the following table schema, each API call has a corresponding URL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE GeoCheckin
(
   region       VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
   state        VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
   time         TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
   weather      VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
   temperature  DOUBLE,
   PRIMARY KEY (
     (region, state, QUANTUM(time, 15, 'm')),
     region, state, time
   )
)
```

| Call  | Request URL         | Type | Description  |
|:------|---------------------|:--------------:|--------------|
|put    | /ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/keys '[»Row(s)«]' | POST | put a single or a batch of rows |
|get    | /ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/keys/region/North%20West/state/WA/time/14201136 | GET | single-key get of a value |
|delete | /ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/keys/region/North%20West/state/WA/time/14201136 | DELETE | single-key delete         |
|query  | /ts/v1/query --data "»Query«"  | POST | execute a query |
|list_keys | /ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/list_keys  | GET | streaming list keys     |

{{% note title="REST purity" %}}
The `query` Call type supports SQL queries, so REST purists may think that the
HTTP verb should be `GET` when the SQL command is a `SELECT` targeting a single
record, `DELETE` when the SQL command is a `DELETE` targeting a single record,
`POST` when the SQL command is an `INSERT`, `PUT` when the SQL command is an
`UPDATE` targeting a single record. However, such purity attempts are stretched
to the breaking point for a SQL command of `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`
targeting multiple records. As SQL is generally oriented at set-based operations
and REST is oriented towards single-document operations, using `POST` to process
set-based operation should be apparently pure. This distinction should help the
developer in reasoning about Riak TS usage over HTTP, including how to properly
cache results, a primary reason for REST purity.

## Percent-encoding

All keys need to be implemented in the query string using percent-encoding (or URL encoding), which can be seen in the examples above for the `get` and `delete` operations. Failing to do so will result in a `400 - Bad Request` response. Percent-encoding variants where a space character is replaced with a `+` will work as expected, but it is recommended that modern variants are used where spaces are encoded as `%20`.

## Blob data

Riak TS 1.5 introduces raw binary data via the `blob` data type. Although such data will be stored in binary inside Riak TS, JSON does not support raw binary data, so the data must be encoded before being sent to, or retrieved from, the server.

The encoding mechanism for binary data in the HTTP API depends on the interface being used.

Note: we do not currently recommend using `blob` columns in the primary key because not all Riak TS APIs deal gracefully with them.

### JSON and base64

Most binary data will be written to from Riak TS using [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding inside JSON. This includes data uploaded via `put` and keys specified as parameters to `put`, `get`, and `delete`.

Blob data inside JSON retrieved from Riak TS will also be base64-encoded, including URLs returned from `list_keys`.

### Hex encoding

Any SQL queries executed via `query` that include comparisons against a `blob` column (currently, the only comparisons supported are equal to or not equal to) must encode the compared data in hex notation.

This notation is an integer value in base 16 preceded by `0x`. The ASCII string "hello" would look like `0x68656c6c6f` (or `0x68656C6C6F`). The value is an integer and thus is **not** escaped using apostrophes as a string value would be.

An example SQL query against a table with a `blob` column named `acceleration_stats`:

```
SELECT * FROM devices WHERE name = 'ACME anvil' and acceleration_stats = 0x001a5942 and time > 0 and time < 1000
```

The results from the query are in JSON and thus will be encoded as `base64`, not hex.


## Keys and Values

| Call      | Method | Type  |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| put       | POST    | Write |
| get       | GET    | Read  |
| delete    | DELETE | Write |
| query     | POST   | Query |
| list_keys | GET    | Read  |

Single-key `get` and `delete` requires the complete primary key to be serialized in the path of the URL, using the order defined in the schema to determine which row to get. The entire row will be returned.

The `put` call uses a full row or a list of full rows in order to add entries to the table.  Each row is specified in a separate tuple.

Streaming `list_keys` returns all the URLs as plain text separated by a new line for all the keys in the table.

The `query` to be executed should be sent as a plain text string in the body of the request.

The value of `»Server«` is the IP address of your system and the HTTP interface port, separated by a colon.  This value is the `listener.http.internal` setting in the `riak.conf` file.


## Returning Results

All request results will be JSON-encoded, except for the streaming list of keys which returns plain text.

Error conditions will be returned by a JSON structure containing an internal error code and a human-readable message, in addition to reporting HTTP status code in the response in the 400 range.

## Examples

Let's write the following rows to the table:

```
"Florida", "Miami", 1234567, "hot", 23.5
"Illinois", "Chicago", 1234568, "windy", 19.8
```

A `put` call can be used to write the two rows:

```
$ curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:8098/ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/keys --data '[{"state":"Florida","city":"Miami","time":1234567,"weather":"hot","temperature":23.5},{"state":"Illinois","city":"Chicago","time":1234568,"weather":"windy","temperature":19.8}]'

{"success":true}
```

A `get` call can be used to read one of the rows:

```
$ curl -XGET http://127.0.0.1:8098/ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/keys/state/Florida/city/Miami/time/1234567

{"state":"Florida","city":"Miami","time":1234567,"weather":"hot","temperature":23.5}
```

A `query` call can be used to run a `SELECT` query to display all columns of the GeoCheckin table and return all rows that satisfy the WHERE clause:

```
$ curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:8098/ts/v1/query --data "SELECT * FROM GeoCheckin WHERE state = 'Illinois' AND city = 'Chicago' AND time >= 1200000 and time <= 1500000"

{"columns":["state","city","time","weather","temperature"],"rows":[["Illinois","Chicago",1234568,"windy",19.8]]}
```

A `list_keys` call can be used to stream a list of keys in the table:

```
$ curl -XGET http://127.0.0.1:8098/ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/list_keys

http://127.0.0.1:8098/ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/keys/state/Florida/city/Miami/time/1234567
http://127.0.0.1:8098/ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/keys/state/Illinois/city/Chicago/time/1234568
```

A `delete` call can be used to delete one of the rows:

```
$ curl -XDELETE http://127.0.0.1:8098/ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/keys/state/Illinois/city/Chicago/time/1234568

{"success":true}
```

The following are bad calls that result in various errors:

```
$ curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:8098/ts/v1/query --data "CREATE TABLE GeoCheckin (state varchar not null, city varchar not null, time timestamp not null, weather varchar not null, temperature double, PRIMARY KEY ((state, city, quantum(timecol, 15, 'm')), state, city, time))"

Query error: Local key does not match primary key
```
```
$ curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:8098/ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/keys --data '[{"state":"Florida","city":"Miami","time":1234567,"weather":50,"temperature":23.5}]'

Bad value for field "weather" of type varchar in table "GeoCheckin"
```
```
$ curl -XGET http://127.0.0.1:8098/ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin2/keys/state/Florida/city/Miami/time/1234567

Table "GeoCheckin2" does not exist
```
```
$ curl -XPOST http://192.168.99.14:8098/ts/v1/query --data "SELECT ? FROM GeoCheckin WHERE state = 'Illinois' AND city = 'Chicago' AND time >= 1200000 and time <= 1500000"

Query error: Unexpected token '?'.
```
```
$ curl -XDELETE http://127.0.0.1:8098/ts/v1/tables/GeoCheckin/keys/state/Colorado/city/Denver/time/1234570

Key not found

```
