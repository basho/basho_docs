## Dependencies

### `ulimit`

OS X gives you a very small limit on open file handles. Even with a
backend that uses very few file handles, it's possible to run out. See
[Open Files Limit][openfileslimit] for more information about changing the limit.

## Install Riak TS

To install Riak TS on your Mac, [download] the package and then run:

```bash
tar zxvf riak-ts-1.5.2-OSX-x86_64.tar.gz
cd riak-ts-1.5.2
```

## Start your Riak TS node

Once you've installed Riak TS, start it on your node:

```bash
riak start
```

## Verify Riak TS is running

You can verify that Riak TS is started and ready to use by pinging it.

```bash
riak ping
```

If Riak TS has started, you will receive a `pong` response. If it has not started, you will receive an error.

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed Riak TS, check out [Planning Your Riak TS Table][planning].
