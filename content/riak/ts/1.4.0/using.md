Now that you've [downloaded][download] and [installed][installing] Riak TS, there's a recommended path for setting up and using it:

1. [Plan][planning] your Riak TS table. Once created, tables can't be edited, so it's important to get it right the first time.
2. [Create and activate][activating] your Riak TS table. (You'll need `sudo` and `su` access for this step.) Then, if you are an Enterprise user, [set up Multi-Datacenter replication][mdc].
3. [Write data][writing] to your table.

Check out [riak shell][riakshell], a handy tool for using TS.
 
Then check out how to [query][querying] your data, [customize your Riak TS configuration][configuring], analyze your data with [aggregate functions][aggregate], or apply some [arithmetic operations][arithmetic].
