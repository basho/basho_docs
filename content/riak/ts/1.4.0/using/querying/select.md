You can use the SELECT statement in Riak TS to query your TS dataset. This document will show you how to run various queries using `SELECT`.

* See the [guidelines] for more information on limitations and rules for queries in TS.
* See [aggregate functions] to learn how turn a set of rows in your Riak TS table into a value.
* See [arithmetic operations] to see a list of operations available with `SELECT`.
* See [GROUP BY] to learn how to condense rows sharing the same value.

For all of the examples on this page, we are using our standard example GeoCheckin table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE GeoCheckin
(
   region       VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
   state        VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
   time         TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
   weather      VARCHAR NOT NULL,
   temperature  DOUBLE,
   PRIMARY KEY (
     (region, state, QUANTUM(time, 15, 'm')),
     region, state, time
   )
)
```

{{% note title="SQL Injection" %}}

When querying with user-supplied data, it is essential that you protect against SQL injection. Please verify the user-supplied data before constructing queries.

## Querying Columns

All queries using `SELECT` must include a 'where' clause with all components.

You can select particular columns from the data to query:

```
select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina'
```

Client-specific examples:

```java
String queryText = "select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin " +
                   "where time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and " +
                   "region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina'";

Query query = new Query.Builder(queryText).build();
QueryResult queryResult = client.execute(query);
```

```ruby
Riak::Timeseries::Query.new(client, "select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina'").issue!
```

```python
fmt = """
select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where
    time > {t1} and time < {t2} and
    region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina'
"""
query = fmt.format(t1=tenMinsAgoMsec, t2=nowMsec)
ts_obj = client.ts_query('GeoCheckin', query)
```

```csharp
var now = DateTime.UtcNow;
var tenMinsAgo = now.AddMinutes(-10);
var qfmt = "SELECT * FROM GeoCheckin WHERE time > {0} and time < {1} and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina'";
var q = string.Format(
    qfmt,
    DateTimeUtil.ToUnixTimeMillis(tenMinsAgo),
    DateTimeUtil.ToUnixTimeMillis(now));

var cmd = new Query.Builder()
    .WithTable("GeoCheckin")
    .WithQuery(q)
    .Build();

RiakResult rslt = client.Execute(cmd);
```

```javascript
var callback = function(err, resp) {
    // resp.rows and resp.columns
    // have data
};
// NB: t1/t2 are integers representing unix timestamps with
// millisecond resolution
var queryText = "select * from GeoCheckin where time > " + t1 +
                " and time < " + t2 +
                " and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina'";
var q = new Riak.Commands.TS.Query.Builder()
    .withQuery(queryText)
    .withCallback(callback)
    .build();
cluster.execute(q);
```

```erlang
riakc_ts:query(Pid, "select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina'").
```

```php
$response = (new Command\Builder\TimeSeries\Query($riak))
    ->withQuery("select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'state1' and time > 1234560 and time < 1234569")
    ->build()
    ->execute();
```

```golang
cmd, err := riak.NewTsQueryCommandBuilder()
    .WithQuery("select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'state1' and time > 1234560 and time < 1234569")
    .Build()

if err != nil {
    return err
}

err = cluster.Execute(cmd)
```

## Extended Queries

You can extend the query beyond the primary key and use secondary columns to filter results. In this example, we are extending our query to filter based on `temperature`:

```
select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina' and temperature > 27.0
```

Client-specific examples:

```java
String queryText = "select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin " +
                   "where time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and " +
                   "region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina' " +
                   "temperature > 27.0";

Query query = new Query.Builder(queryText).build();
QueryResult queryResult = client.execute(query);
```

```ruby
Riak::Timeseries::Query.new(client, "select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina' and temperature > 27.0").issue!
```

```python
fmt = """
select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where
    time > {t1} and time < {t2} and
    region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina' and
    temperature > 27.0
"""
query = fmt.format(t1=tenMinsAgoMsec, t2=nowMsec)
ts_obj = client.ts_query('GeoCheckin', query)
```

```csharp
var now = DateTime.UtcNow;
var tenMinsAgo = now.AddMinutes(-10);
var qfmt = "SELECT weather, temperature FROM GeoCheckin WHERE time > {0} and time < {1} and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina' and temperature > 27.0";
var q = string.Format(
    qfmt,
    DateTimeUtil.ToUnixTimeMillis(tenMinsAgo),
    DateTimeUtil.ToUnixTimeMillis(now));

var cmd = new Query.Builder()
    .WithTable("GeoCheckin")
    .WithQuery(q)
    .Build();

RiakResult rslt = client.Execute(cmd);
```

```javascript
var callback = function(err, resp) {
    // resp.rows and resp.columns
    // have data
};
// NB: t1/t2 are integers representing unix timestamps with
// millisecond resolution
var queryText = "select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where time > " + t1 +
                " and time < " + t2 +
                " and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina'" +
                " and temperature > 27.0";
var q = new Riak.Commands.TS.Query.Builder()
    .withQuery(queryText)
    .withCallback(callback)
    .build();
cluster.execute(q);
```

```erlang
riakc_ts:query(Pid, "select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina' and temperature > 27.0").
```

```php
$response = (new Command\Builder\TimeSeries\Query($riak))
    ->withQuery("select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'state1' and time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and temperature > 27.0")
    ->build()
    ->execute();
```

```golang
cmd, err := riak.NewTsQueryCommandBuilder()
    .WithQuery("select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'state1' and time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and temperature > 27.0")
    .Build()

if err != nil {
    return err
}

err = cluster.Execute(cmd)
```

You can also use `or` when querying against column values, such as `temperature` in our example. Note that the parentheses are required:

```
select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina' and (temperature > 27.0 or temperature < 0.0)
```

You cannot use `or` between two complete clauses, since keys cannot be specified twice.

## ISO 8601

It is possible to use [ISO 8601]-compliant date/time strings in SELECT statements instead of integer timestamps:

```
time > '2015-12-11 20:04:37' and time < '2015-12-11 20:04:50'
```

You cannot use [reduced accuracy time representations][iso8601 accuracy]. Instead, you must specify your time down to the second (or use fractional
times).

ISO 8601 time strings are converted to a millisecond timestamp, which the query then uses.

```sql
select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where time > '2009-11-01 03:15:00+07' and time < '2009-11-01 03:45:00+07' and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina'
```

The timestamps used inside Riak TS for those comparisons will be
1257020100000 and 1257021900000.

The same query, expressed with fractional time:

```
select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin where time > '2009-11-01 03.25+07' and time < '2009-11-01 03.75+07' and region = 'South Atlantic' and state = 'South Carolina'
```

See [our documentation on ISO 8601 support][iso8601] for more details on how to use ISO 8601.
