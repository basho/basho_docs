Depending on your needs, you can configure Riak TS in each node's riak.conf file.

## Configuration options

### Timeout

Use `timeseries_query_timeout_ms` to configure the timeout (in milliseconds) for queries, after which a timeout error is returned.

```riak.conf
timeseries_query_timeout_ms = 10000
```

### Maximum quanta

Use `timeseries_query_max_quanta_span` to configure the maximum number of quanta that a query can span.  The quanta relates to the table's quantum.

```
timeseries_query_max_quanta_span = 3
```

For example, if you set `quantum(time, 15, 'm')` in your Riak TS table, setting `timeseries_query_max_quanta_span` to '5' would allow a query to return results within a time span of 75 minutes.  If a query has a larger time span, an error would be returned to the client and the query would not run.

This option is intended to prevent excessively long-running queries that could affect the performance of the cluster.


### Maximum queries

Use `timeseries_max_concurrent_queries` to set the maximum number of queries that can run concurrently per node. The total number of queries that can be run on a cluster is the number of nodes multiplied by the `timeseries_max_concurrent_queries` value. This constraint is to prevent an unbounded number of queries overloading the cluster.

```
timeseries_max_concurrent_queries = 3
```
