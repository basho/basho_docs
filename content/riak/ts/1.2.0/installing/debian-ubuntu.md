## Dependencies

### PAM Library Requirement for Ubuntu

You must have the `libpam0g-dev` package used for [Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)][security basics] authentication in order to install Riak TS.

To install this dependency:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpam0g-dev
```

## Install Riak TS

Once you have downloaded the package from ZenDesk, execute the following command to install Riak TS:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i riak-ts_{{VERSION}}-1_amd64.deb
```

Then confirm that [AAE][concept aae] is turned off. To do this, check /etc/riak/riak.conf for the following: `anti_entropy = passive`.

## Activate Riak TS node

Once you've installed Riak TS, start it on your node:

```bash
riak start
```

## Verify your installation

You can verify that Riak TS is successfully installed by running:

```bash
dpkg -l | grep riak
```

If Riak TS has been installed successfully `riak-ts` is returned.

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed Riak TS, check out [Planning Your Riak TS Table][planning].
