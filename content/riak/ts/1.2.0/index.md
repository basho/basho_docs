Riak TS is a distributed NoSQL key/value store optimized for time series data. It provides a time series database solution that is extensible and scalable.

Riak TS includes a complete build of Riak KV, but adds the ability to co-locate keys of the same series within the same quanta for fast and efficient READs. As  an available and partition-tolerant time series database, Riak TS uses a subset of SQL to make querying even easier.
