## How Version 3 Replication Works

In Multi-Datacenter (MDC) Replication, a cluster can act as either the

* **source cluster**, which sends replication data to one or
* **sink clusters**, which are generally located in datacenters in other
  regions or countries.

Bidirectional replication can easily be established by making a cluster
both a source and sink to other clusters. Riak Enterprise
Multi-Datacenter Replication is considered "masterless" in that all
clusters participating will resolve replicated writes via the normal
resolution methods available in Riak.

In Multi-Datacenter Replication, there are two primary modes of
operation:

* **Fullsync** replication is a complete synchronization that occurs
  between source and sink cluster(s), which can be performed upon
  initial connection of a sink cluster if you wish
* **Realtime** replication is a continual, incremental synchronization
  triggered by successful writing of new updates on the source cluster

Fullsync and realtime replication modes are described in detail below.

## Concepts

### Sources

A source refers to a cluster that is the primary producer of replication
data. A source can also refer to any node that is part of the source
cluster. Source clusters push data to sink clusters.

### Sinks

A sink refers to a cluster that is the primary consumer of replication
data. A sink can also refer to any node that is part of the sink
cluster. Sink clusters receive data from source clusters.

### Cluster Manager

The cluster manager is a Riak Enterprise service that provides
information regarding nodes and protocols supported by the sink and
source clusters. This information is primarily consumed by the
`riak-repl connect` command.

### Fullsync Coordinator

In fullsync replication, a node on the source cluster is elected to be
the *fullsync coordinator*. This node is responsible for starting and
stopping replication to the sink cluster. It also communicates with the
sink cluster to exchange key lists and ultimately transfer data across a
TCP connection. If a fullsync coordinator is terminated as the result of
an error, it will automatically restart on the current node. If the node
becomes unresponsive, a leader election will take place within 5 seconds
to select a new node from the cluster to become the coordinator. In the
event of a coordinator restart, a fullsync will have to restart.

## Fullsync Replication

Fullsync replication scans through the list of partitions in a Riak
cluster and determines which objects in the sink cluster need to be
updated. A source partition is synchronized to a node on the sink
cluster containing the current partition.

## Realtime Replication

In realtime replication, a node in the source cluster will forward data
to the sink cluster. A node in the source cluster does not necessarily
connect to a node containing the same [vnode][glossary vnode] on
the sink cluster. This allows Riak to spread out realtime replication
across the entire cluster, thus improving throughput and making
replication more fault tolerant.

### Initialization

Before a source cluster can begin pushing realtime updates to a sink,
the following commands must be issued:

1. `riak-repl realtime enable <sink_cluster>`

    After this command, the realtime queues (one for each Riak node) are
    populated with updates to the source cluster, ready to be pushed to
    the sink.

2. `riak-repl realtime start <sink_cluster>`

    This instructs the Riak connection manager to contact the sink
    cluster.

    <br />

    At this point realtime replication commences.

<ol start="3">
<li>Nodes with queued updates establish connections to the sink cluster
and replication begins.</li>
</ol>

<br />

<br />

### Realtime queueing and synchronization

Once initialized, realtime replication continues to use the queues to
store data updates for synchronization.

<ol start="4">
<li>The client sends an object to store on the source cluster.</li>
<li>Riak writes N replicas on the source cluster.</li>
</ol>

<br />

<br />

<ol start="6">
<li>The new object is stored in the realtime queue.</li>
<li>The object is copied to the sink cluster.</li>
</ol>

<br />
![MDC fullsync]({{<baseurl>}}images/MDC-v3-realtime4.png)
<br />

<ol start="8">
<li>The destination node on the sink cluster writes the object to N
nodes.</li>
</ol>

<br />
![MDC fullsync]({{<baseurl>}}images/MDC-v3-realtime5.png)
<br />

<ol start="9">
<li>The successful write of the object to the sink cluster is
acknowledged and the object removed from the realtime queue.</li>
</ol>

<br />

## Restrictions

It is important to note that both clusters must have certain attributes
in common for Multi-Datacenter Replication to work. If you are using
either fullsync or realtime replication, both clusters must have the
same [ring size][concept clusters]; if you are using fullsync
replication, every bucket's `n_val` must be the same in both the
source and sink cluster.
