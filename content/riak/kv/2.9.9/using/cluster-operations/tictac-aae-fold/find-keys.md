Returns a list of keys that meet the filter parameters.

See the [TicTac AAE `aae_folds`][tictacaae folds-overview] documentation for configuration, tuning and troubleshootings help.

## The `find_keys` function

Run this using [`riak attach`][riak attach].

This function will find all keys that meet the common filters as well as one of two function-specific filters (`function_filter`) that filter by minimum sibling count or by minimum object size (but not both at the same time).

```riakattach
riak_client:aae_fold({
    find_keys,
    bucket_filter,
    key_range_filter,
    modified_filter,
    function_filter
    }, Client).
```

Please see the list of [available standard filters](#available-standard-filters) below.

`function_filter` can be either the `sibling_count` filter or the `object_size` filter, detailed below.

## The `sibling_count` filter

This filter will only include keys that have more than the specified siblings.

Note that a value of `5` will mean only objects with 6 or more siblings will be returned.

```riakattach
riak_client:aae_fold({
    find_keys,
    bucket_filter,
    key_range_filter,
    modified_filter,
    {sibling_count, count}
    }, Client).
```

Please see the list of [available standard filters](#available-standard-filters) below.

For example, the following snippet will return all keys with the filters:

- in the bucket "dogs" of bucket type "animals"
- whose keys are between "A" and "N"
- which were modified in January 2022
- which have more than 5 siblings

```riakattach
riak_client:aae_fold({
    find_keys,
    {<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>},
    {<<"A">>,<<"N">>},
    {date,1640995200,1643673600},
    {sibling_count, 5}
    }, Client).
```

How to get the value for `Client` is detailed in [The Riak Client](../../tictac-aae-fold#the-riak-client).

## The response using the `sibling_count` filter

The response will be an array of `{bucket_name,key_name,sibling_count}` tuples that will look something like this:

```erlang
{ok,[{{<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>},<<"Barkie">>,15},
    {{<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>},<<"Lord Snuffles III">>,6}]}
```

This indicates that two objects were found with more than 5 siblings:

- "Barkie" in the bucket "dogs" of bucket type "animals" has 15 siblings
- "Lord Snuffles III" in the bucket "dogs" of bucket type "animals" has 6 siblings

For each object found, an additional `{bucket_name,key_name,sibling_count}` tuple will be added to the array.

Field | Example | Description
:-------|:--------|:--------
bucket_name | `<<"cars">>` or `{<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>}` | The bucket name as an Erlang binary. In the case of a bucket with a bucket type, a tuple of bucket type and bucket name.
key_name | `<<"Barkie">>` | The key name as an Erlang binary.
sibling_count | 15 | The number of siblings of the object.

## The `object_size` filter

This filter will include keys that have an object size of more than the specified size.

Note that a value of `1000` will mean only objects with a size of 1001 bytes or more will be returned.

```riakattach
riak_client:aae_fold({
    find_keys,
    bucket_filter,
    key_range_filter,
    modified_filter,
    {object_size, size}
    }, Client).
```

Please see the list of [available standard filters](#available-standard-filters) below.

For example, the following snippet will return all keys with the filters:

- in the bucket "dogs" of bucket type "animals"
- whose keys are between "A" and "N"
- which were modified in January 2022
- which are more than 1000 bytes in size

```riakattach
riak_client:aae_fold({
    find_keys,
    {<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>},
    {<<"A">>,<<"N">>},
    {date,1640995200,1643673600},
    {object_size, 1000}
    }, Client).
```

## The response using the `object_size` filter

The response will be an array of `{bucket_name,key_name,object_size}` tuples that will look something like this:

```erlang
{ok,[{{<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>},<<"Barkie">>,5000},
    {{<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>},<<"Lord Snuffles III">>,10550400}]}
```

This indicates that two objects were found with more than 5 siblings:

- "Barkie" in the bucket "dogs" of bucket type "animals" has a size of 5000 bytes
- "Lord Snuffles III" in the bucket "dogs" of bucket type "animals" has a size of 10,550,400 bytes

For each object found, an additional `{bucket_name,key_name,object_size}` tuple will be added to the array.

Field | Example | Description
:-------|:--------|:--------
bucket_name | `<<"cars">>` or `{<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>}` | The bucket name as an Erlang binary. In the case of a bucket with a bucket type, a tuple of bucket type and bucket name.
key_name | `<<"Barkie">>` | The key name as an Erlang binary.
object_size | 5000 | The size of the object.

## Available standard filters

These filters are detailed in the [Filters][filters] documentation and can be used to limit the keys counted.

These filters will reduce the keys to be searched:

- [`bucket_filter`][filter-by bucket]
- [`key_range_filter`][filter-by key-range]

These filters will reduce the number of objects included in the statistics:

- [`modified_filter`][filter-by modified]
