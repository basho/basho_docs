Lists all known buckets (ones that have keys stored in them).

{{% note title="Not for production use" %}}
Similar to the list keys operation, this requires traversing all keys stored
in the cluster and should not be used in production.
{{% /note %}}

## Request

```bash
# Using the default bucket type
GET /buckets?buckets=true

# Using a non-default bucket type
GET /types/<type>/buckets?buckets=true
```

Required query parameter:

* **buckets=true** - required to invoke the list-buckets functionality

## Response

Normal status codes:

* `200 OK`

Important headers:

* `Content-Type - application/json`

The JSON object in the response will contain a single entry, "buckets", which
will be an array of bucket names.
