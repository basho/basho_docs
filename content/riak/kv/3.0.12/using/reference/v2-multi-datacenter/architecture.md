This document provides a basic overview of the architecture undergirding
Riak's Multi-Datacenter Replication capabilities.

## How Replication Works

When Multi-Datacenter Replication is implemented, one Riak cluster acts
as a **primary cluster**. The primary cluster handles replication
requests from one or more **secondary clusters** (generally located in
datacenters in other regions or countries). If the datacenter with the
primary cluster goes down, a secondary cluster can take over as the
primary cluster. In this sense, Riak's multi-datacenter capabilities are
masterless.

Multi-Datacenter Replication has two primary modes of operation:
**fullsync** and **realtime**. In fullsync mode, a complete
synchronization occurs between primary and secondary cluster(s); in
realtime mode, continual, incremental synchronization occurs, i.e.
replication is triggered by new updates.

Fullsync is performed upon initial connection of a secondary cluster,
and then periodically thereafter (every 360 minutes is the default, but
this can be modified). Fullsync is also triggered if the TCP connection
between primary and secondary cluster is severed and then recovered.

Both fullsync and realtime mode are described in detail below.
But first, a few key concepts.

## Concepts

### Listener Nodes

Listeners, also called **servers**, are Riak nodes in the primary
cluster that listen on an external IP address for replication requests.
Any node in a Riak cluster can participate as a listener. Adding more
nodes will increase the fault tolerance of the replication process in
the event of individual node failures. If a listener node goes down,
another node can take its place.

### Site Nodes

Site nodes, also called **clients**, are Riak nodes on a secondary
cluster that connect to listener nodes and send replication initiation
requests. Site nodes are paired with a listener node when started.

### Leadership

Only one node in each cluster will serve as the lead site (client) or
listener (server) node. Riak replication uses a leadership-election
protocol to determine which node in the cluster will participate in
replication. If a site connects to a node in the primary cluster that is
not the leader, it will be redirected to the listener node that is
currently the leader.

## Fullsync Replication

Riak performs the following steps during fullsync
replication, as illustrated in the Figure below.

1. A TCP connection is established between the primary and secondary
   clusters
2. The site node in the secondary cluster initiates fullsync replication
   with the primary node by sending a message to the listener node in
   the primary cluster
3. The site and listener nodes iterate through each [vnode]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/3.0.12/learn/glossary/#vnode) in their respective clusters and compute a hash for
   each key's object value. The site node on the secondary cluster sends
   its complete list of key/hash pairs to the listener node in the
   primary cluster. The listener node then sequentially compares its
   key/hash pairs with the primary cluster's pairs, identifying any
   missing objects or updates needed in the secondary cluster.
4. The listener node streams the missing objects/updates to the
   secondary cluster.
5. The secondary cluster replicates the updates within the cluster to
   achieve the new object values, completing the fullsync cycle

## Realtime Replication

Riak performs the following steps during realtime
replication, as illustrated in the Figure below.

1. The secondary cluster establishes a TCP connection to the primary
2. Realtime replication of a key/object is initiated when an update is
   sent from a client to the primary cluster
3. The primary cluster replicates the object locally
4. The listener node on the primary cluster streams an update to the
   secondary cluster
5. The site node within the secondary cluster receives and replicates
   the update

## Restrictions

It is important to note that both clusters must have certain attributes
in common for Multi-Datacenter Replication to work. If you are using
either fullsync or realtime replication, both clusters must have the
same [ring size]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/3.0.12/learn/concepts/clusters/#the-ring); if you are using fullsync
replication, every bucket's [`n_val`]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/3.0.12/developing/app-guide/replication-properties#n-value-and-replication) must be the same in both the
source and sink cluster.
