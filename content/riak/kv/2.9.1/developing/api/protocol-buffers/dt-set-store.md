An operation to update a set, either on its own (at the bucket/key
level) or [inside of a map]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.1/developing/api/protocol-buffers/dt-map-store).

## Request

```protobuf
message SetOp {
    repeated bytes adds    = 1;
    repeated bytes removes = 2;
}
```

Set members are binary values that can only be added (`adds`) or removed
(`removes`) from a set. You can add and/or remove as many members of a
set in a single message as you would like.
