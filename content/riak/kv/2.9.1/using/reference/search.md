The project that implements Riak search is codenamed Yokozuna. This is a
more detailed overview of the concepts and reasons behind the design of
Yokozuna, for those interested. If you're simply looking to use Riak
search, you should check out the [Using Search]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.1/developing/usage/search) document.

## Riak Search is Erlang

In Erlang OTP, an "application" is a group of modules and Erlang
processes which together perform a specific task. The word application
is confusing because most people think of an application as an entire
program such as Emacs or Photoshop. But Riak Search is just a sub-system
in Riak itself. Erlang applications are often stand-alone, but Riak
Search is more like an appendage of Riak. It requires other subsystems
like Riak Core and KV, but also extends their functionality by providing
search capabilities for KV data.

The purpose of Riak Search is to bring more sophisticated and robust
query and search support to Riak. Many people consider Lucene and
programs built on top of it, such as Solr, as the standard for
open-source search. There are many successful applications built on
Lucene/Solr, and it sets the standard for the feature set that
developers and users expect.  Meanwhile, Riak has a great story as a
highly-available, distributed key/value store. Riak Search takes
advantage of the fact that Riak already knows how to do the distributed
bits, combining its feature set with that of Solr, taking advantage of
the strengths of each.

Riak Search is a mediator between Riak and Solr. There is nothing
stopping a user from deploying these two programs separately, but this
would leave the user responsible for the glue between them. That glue
can be tricky to write. It requires dealing with monitoring, querying,
indexing, and dissemination of information.

Unlike Solr by itself, Riak Search knows how to do all of the following:

* Listen for changes in key/value (KV) data and to make the appropriate
  changes to indexes that live in Solr. It also knows how to take a user
  query on any node and convert it to a Solr distributed search, which
  will correctly cover the entire index without overlap in replicas.
* Take index creation commands and disseminate that information across
  the cluster.
* Communicate and monitor the Solr OS process.

## Solr/JVM OS Process

Every node in a Riak [cluster][concept clusters] has a corresponding operating
system (OS) process running a JVM which hosts Solr on the Jetty
application server. This OS process is a child of the Erlang OS process
running Riak.

Riak Search has a `gen_server` process which monitors the JVM OS
process. The code for this server is in `yz_solr_proc`. When the JVM
process crashes, this server crashes, causing its supervisor to restart
it.

If there is more than 1 restart in 45 seconds, the entire Riak node will
be shut down. If Riak Search is enabled and Solr cannot function for
some reason, the Riak node needs to go down so that the user will notice
and take corrective action.

Conversely, the JVM process monitors the Riak process. If for any reason
Riak goes down hard (e.g. a segfault) the JVM process will also exit.
This double monitoring along with the crash semantics means that neither
process may exist without the other. They are either both up or both
down.

All other communication between Riak Search and Solr is performed via
HTTP, including querying, indexing, and administration commands.  The
ibrowse Erlang HTTP client is used to manage these communications as
both it and the Jetty container hosting Solr pool HTTP connections,
allowing for reuse. Moreover, since there is no `gen_server` involved in
this communication, there's no serialization point to bottleneck.

## Indexes

An index, stored as a set of files on disk, is a logical namespace that
contains index entries for objects. Each such index maintains its own
set of files on disk---a critical difference from Riak KV, in which a
bucket is a purely logical entity and not physically disjoint at all. A
Solr index requires significantly less disk space than the corresponding
legacy Riak Search index, depending on the Solr schema used.

Indexes may be associated with zero or more buckets. At creation time,
however, each index has no associated buckets---unlike the legacy Riak
Search, indexes in the new Riak Search do not implicitly create bucket
associations, meaning that this must be done as a separate configuration
step.

To associate a bucket with an index, the bucket property `search_index` must
be set to the name of the index you wish to associate. Conversely, in
order to disassociate a bucket you use the sentinel value
`_dont_index_`.

Many buckets can be associated with the same index. This is useful for
logically partitioning data into different KV buckets which are of the
same type of data, for example if a user wanted to store event objects
but logically partition them in KV by using a date as the bucket name.

A bucket _cannot_ be associated with many indexes---the `search_index`
property must be a single name, not a list.

See the [main Search documentation]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.1/developing/usage/search/#simple-setup) for details on creating an index.

## Extractors

There is a tension between Riak KV and Solr when it comes to data. Riak
KV treats object values as mostly opaque, and while KV does maintain an
associated content type, it is simply treated as metadata to be returned
to the user to provide context for interpreting the returned object.
Otherwise, the user wouldn't know what type of data it is!

Solr, on the other hand, wants semi-structured data, more specifically a
flat collection of field-value pairs. "Flat" here means that a field's
value cannot be a nested structure of field-value pairs; the values are
treated as-is (non-composite is another way to say it).

Because of this mismatch between KV and Solr, Riak Search must act as a
mediator between the two, meaning it must have a way to inspect a KV
object and create a structure which Solr can ingest for indexing. In
Solr this structure is called a **document**. This task of creating a
Solr document from a Riak object is the job of the **extractor**. To
perform this task two things must be considered.

**Note**: This isn't quite right, the fields created by the extractor
are only a subset of the fields created. Special fields needed for
Yokozuna to properly query data and tagging fields are also created.
This call happens inside `yz_doc:make_doc`.

1. Does an extractor exist to map the content-type of the object to a
   Solr document?
2. If so, how is the object's value mapped from one to the other?
   For example, the value may be `application/json` which contains
   nested objects. This must somehow be transformed into a flat
   structure.

The first question is answered by the _extractor mapping_. By default
Yokozuna ships with extractors for several common data types. Below is a
table of this default mapping:

Content Type | Erlang Module
:------------|:-------------
`application/json` | `yz_json_extractor`
`application/xml`  | `yz_xml_extractor`
`text/plain`       | `yz_text_extractor`
`text/xml`         | `yz_xml_extractor`
N/A                | `yz_noop_extractor`

The answer to the second question is a function of the implementation
of the extractor module. Every extractor must conform to the
following Erlang specification:

```erlang
-spec(ObjectValue::binary(), Options::proplist()) -> fields() | {error, term()}.
-type field_name() :: atom() | binary().
-type field_value() :: binary().
-type fields() :: [{field_name(), field_value()}]
```

The value of the object is passed along with options specific to each
extractor. Assuming the extractor correctly parses the value it will
return a list of fields, which are name-value pairs.

The text extractor is the simplest one. By default it will use the
object's value verbatim and associate if with the field name `text`.
For example, an object with the value "How much wood could a woodchuck
chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?" would result in the following
fields list.

```erlang
[{text, <<"How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?">>}]
```

An object with the content type `application/json` is a little trickier.
JSON can be nested arbitrarily. That is, the key of a top-level object
can have an object as a value, and this object can have another object
nested inside, an so on. Yokozuna's JSON extractor must have some method
of converting this arbitrary nesting into a flat list. It does this by
concatenating nested object fields with a separator. The default
separator is `.`. An example should make this more clear.

Below is JSON that represents a person, what city they are from and what
cities they have traveled to.

```json
{
  "name": "ryan",
  "info": {
    "city": "Baltimore",
    "visited": ["Boston", "New York", "San Francisco"]
  }
}
```

Below is the field list that would be created by the JSON extract.

```erlang
[{<<"info.visited">>,<<"San Francisco">>},
 {<<"info.visited">>,<<"New York">>},
 {<<"info.visited">>,<<"Boston">>},
 {<<"info.city">>,<<"Baltimore">>},
 {<<"name">>,<<"ryan">>}]
```

Some key points to notice.

* Nested objects have their field names concatenated to form a field
  name. The default field separator is `.`. This can be modified.
* Any array causes field names to repeat.  This will require that your
  schema defines this field as multi-valued.

The XML extractor works in very similar fashion to the JSON extractor
except it also has element attributes to worry about. To see the
document created for an object, without actually writing the object, you
can use the extract HTTP endpoint. This will do a dry-run extraction and
return the document structure as `application/json`.

```curl
curl -XPUT http://localhost:8098/search/extract \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-binary @object.json
```

## Schemas

Every index must have a schema, which is a collection of field names and
types. For each document stored, every field must have a matching name
in the schema, used to determine the field's type, which in turn
determines how a field's value will be indexed.

Currently, Yokozuna makes no attempts to hide any details of the Solr
schema: a user creates a schema for Yokozuna just as she would for Solr.
Here is the general structure of a schema.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<schema name="my-schema" version="1.5">
  <fields>
    <!-- field definitions go here -->
  </fields>

  <!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS -->
  <uniqueKey>_yz_id</uniqueKey>

  <types>
    <!-- field type definitions go here -->
  </types>
</schema>
```

The `<fields>` element is where the field name, type, and overriding
options are declared. Here is an example of a field for indexing dates.

```xml
<field name="created" type="date" indexed="true" stored="true"/>
```

The corresponding date type is declared under `<types>` like so.

```xml
<fieldType name="date" class="solr.TrieDateField" precisionStep="0" positionIncrementGap="0"/>
```

You can also find more information on to how customize your own [search schema]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.1/developing/usage/search-schemas).

Yokozuna comes bundled with a [default schema](https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/blob/develop/priv/default_schema.xml)
called `_yz_default`. This is an extremely general schema which makes
heavy use of dynamic fields---it is intended for development and
testing. In production, a schema should be tailored to the data being
indexed.

## Active Anti-Entropy (AAE)

[Active Anti-Entropy]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.1/learn/concepts/active-anti-entropy/) \(AAE) is the process of discovering and
correcting entropy (divergence) between the data stored in Riak's
key-value backend and the indexes stored in Solr. The impetus for AAE is
that failures come in all shapes and sizes---disk failure, dropped
messages, network partitions, timeouts, overflowing queues, segment
faults, power outages, etc. Failures range from obvious to invisible.
Failure prevention is fraught with failure, as well. How do you prevent
your prevention system from failing? You don't. Code for detection, not
prevention. That is the purpose of AAE.

Constantly reading and re-indexing every object in Riak could be quite
expensive. To minimize the overall cost of detection AAE make use of
hashtrees. Every partition has a pair of hashtrees; one for KV and
another for Yokozuna. As data is written the hashtrees are updated in
real-time.

Each tree stores the hash of the object. Periodically a partition is
selected and the pair of hashtrees is _exchanged_. First the root hashes
are compared. If equal then there is no more work to do. You could have
millions of keys in one partition and verifying they **all** agree takes
the same time as comparing two hashes. If they don't match then the
root's children are checked and this process continues until the
individual discrepancies are found. If either side is missing a key or
the hashes for a key do not match then _repair_ is invoked on that key.
Repair converges the KV data and its indexes, removing the entropy.

Since failure is inevitable, and absolute prevention impossible, the
hashtrees themselves may contain some entropy. For example, what if the
root hashes agree but a divergence exists in the actual data?  Simple,
you assume you can never fully trust the hashtrees so periodically you
_expire_ them. When expired, a tree is completely destroyed and the
re-built from scratch. This requires folding all data for a partition,
which can be expensive and take some time. For this reason, by default,
expiration occurs after one week.

[screencast](http://coffee.jtuple.com/video/AAE.html).

## Analysis & Analyzers

Analysis is the process of breaking apart (analyzing) text into a
stream of tokens. Solr allows many different methods of analysis,
an important fact because different field values may represent
different types of data. For data like unique identifiers, dates, and
categories you want to index the value verbatim---it shouldn't be
analyzed at all. For text like product summaries, or a blog post,
you want to split the value into individual words so that they may be
queried individually. You may also want to remove common words,
lowercase words, or perform stemming. This is the process of
_analysis_.

Solr provides many different field types which analyze data in different
ways, and custom analyzer chains may be built by stringing together XML
in the schema file, allowing custom analysis for each field. For more
information on analysis, see [Search Schema]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.1/developing/usage/search-schemas).

## Tagging

Tagging is the process of adding field-value pairs to be indexed via
Riak object metadata. It is useful in two scenarios.

1. The object being stored is opaque but your application has metadata
   about it that should be indexed, for example storing an image with
   location or category metadata.

2. The object being stored is not opaque, but additional indexes must
   be added _without_ modifying the object's value.

See
[Tagging](https://github.com/basho/yokozuna/blob/develop/docs/TAGGING.md)
for more information.

## Coverage

Yokozuna uses _doc-based partitioning_. This means that all index
entries for a given Riak Object are co-located on the same physical
machine. To query the entire index all partitions must be contacted.
Adjacent partitions keep replicas of the same object. Replication allows
the entire index to be considered by only contacting a subset of the
partitions. The process of finding a covering set of partitions is known
as _coverage_.

Each partition in the coverage plan has an owning node. Thus a plan can
be thought of as a unique set of nodes along with a covering set of
partitions. Yokozuna treats the node list as physical hostnames and
passes them to Solr's distributed search via the `shards` parameter.
Partitions, on the other hand, are treated logically in Yokozuna. All
partitions for a given node are stored in the same index; unlike KV
which uses _partition_ as a physical separation. To properly filter out
overlapping replicas the partition data from the cover plan is passed to
Solr via the filter query (`fq`) parameter.

Calculating a coverage plan is handled by Riak Core. It can be a very
expensive operation as much computation is done symbolically, and the
process amounts to a knapsack problem. The larger the ring the more
expensive. Yokozuna takes advantage of the fact that it has no physical
partitions by computing a coverage plan asynchronously every few
seconds, caching the plan for query use. In the case of node failure or
ownership change this could mean a delay between cluster state and the
cached plan. This is, however, a good trade-off given the performance
benefits, especially since even without caching there is a race, albeit
one with a smaller window.

## Statistics

The Riak Search batching subsystem provides statistics on run-time characteristics of search system components. These statistics are accessible via the standard Riak KV stats interfaces and can be monitored through standard enterprise management tools.

* `search_index_throughput_(count|one)` - The total count of objects that have been indexed, per Riak node, and the count of objects that have been indexed within the metric measurement window.

* `search_index_latency_(min|mean|max|median|95|99|999)` - The minimum, mean, maximum, median, 95th percentile, 99th percentile, and 99.9th percentile measurements of indexing latency, as measured from the time it takes to send a batch to Solr to the time the response is received from Solr, divided by the batch size.

* `search_queue_batch_latency_(min|mean|max|median|95|99|999)` - The minimum, mean, maximum, median, 95th percentile, 99th percentile, and 99.9th percentile measurements of batch latency, as measured from the time it takes to send a batch to Solr to the time the response is received from Solr.

* `search_queue_batch_throughput_(count|one)` - The total number of batches delivered into Solr, per Riak node, and the number of batches that have been indexed within the metric measurement window.

* `search_queue_batchsize_(min|mean|max|median)` - The minimum, mean, maximum, and median measurements of the batch size across all indices and Solrq worker processes.

* `search_queue_hwm_purged_(count|one)` - The total number of purged objects, and the number of purged objects within the metric measurement window.

* `search_queue_capacity` - The capacity of the existing queues, expressed as a integral percentage value between 0 and 100. This measurement is based on the ratio of equeued objects and the configured high water mark.

* `search_queue_drain_(count|one)` - The total number of drain operations, and the number of drain operations within the metric measurement window.

* `search_queue_drain_fail_(count|one)` - The total number of drain failures, and the number of drain failures within the metric measurement window.

* `search_queue_drain_timeout_(count|one)` - The total number of drain timeouts, and the number of drain timeouts within the metric measurement window.

* `search_queue_drain_latency_(min|mean|max|median|95|99|999)` - The minimum, mean, maximum, median, 95th percentile, 99th percentile, and 99.9th percentile measurements of drain latency, as measured from the time it takes to initiate a drain to the time the drain is completed.

* `search_detected_repairs_count` - The total number of AAE repairs that have been detected when comparing YZ and Riak/KV AAE trees. Note that this statistic is a measurement of the differences found in the AAE trees; there may be some latency between the time the trees are compared and the time that the repair is written to Solr.

* `search_blockedvnode_(count|one)` - The total count of vnodes that have been blocked, per Riak node, and the count of blocked vnodes within the metric measurement window. Vnodes are blocked when a Solrq worker exceeds its high water mark, as defined by the [`search.queue.high_watermark`][configuring search] configuration setting.

* `search_index_fail_(count|one)` - The total count of failed attempts to index, per Riak node, and the count of index failures within the metric measurement window.

* `search_query_throughput_(count|one)` - The total count of queries, per Riak node, and the count of queries within the metric measurement window.

* `search_query_latency_(min|mean|max|median|95|99|999)` - The minimum, mean, maximum, median, 95th percentile, 99th percentile, and 99.9th percentile measurements of querying latency, as measured from the time it takes to send a request to Solr to the time the response is received from Solr.

* `search_query_fail_(count|one)` - The total count of failed queries, per Riak node, and the count of query failures within the metric measurement window.

* `search_index_bad_entry_count` - the number of writes to Solr that have resulted in an error due to the format of the data (e.g., non-unicode data) since the last restart of Riak.

* `search_index_bad_entry_one` - the number of writes to Solr that have resulted in an error due to the format of the data (e.g., non-unicode data) within the past minute.

* `search_index_extract_fail_count` - the number of failures that have occurred extracting data into a format suitable for Solr (e.g., badly formatted JSON) since the last start of Riak.

* `search_index_extract_fail_one` - the number of failures that have occurred extracting data into a format suitable for Solr (e.g., badly formatted JSON) within the past minute.

While most of the default values are sufficient, you may have to
increase [`search.solr.start_timeout`][configuring search] as more data is indexed, which may cause Solr to require more time to start.
