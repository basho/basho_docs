This tutorial shows you how to set up a Riak Ruby client to authenticate
itself when connecting to Riak.

If you are using [trust-]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/3.2.0/using/security/managing-sources/) or [PAM]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/3.2.0/using/security/managing-sources/#pam-based-authentication)-based authentication, you
can use the security setup described in the [Ruby Client Basics](#ruby-client-basics) section.
[Password]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/3.2.0/using/security/managing-sources/#password-based-authentication)-based authentication is covered
in a [later section](#password-based-authentication), while [certificate]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/3.2.0/using/security/managing-sources/#certificate-based-authentication)-based authentication
is covered [further down](#certificate-based-authentication).

{{% note title="Note on certificate generation" %}}
This tutorial does not cover certificate generation. It assumes that all
necessary certificates have already been created and are stored in a directory
called `/ssl_dir`. This directory name is used only for example purposes.

## Ruby Client Basics

When connecting to Riak using a Ruby-based client, you must instantiate
an object from the `Riak::Client` class that then handles interactions
with Riak (you may have more than one client object active in an
application if you wish). All authentication-related information that
needs to be used can be passed to the object upon instantiation in an
`authentication` hash.

If you are using Riak Security, _all_ connecting clients should have
access to the same Certificate Authority (CA) used on the server side,
regardless of which [security source]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/3.2.0/using/security/managing-sources/) you choose. All clients should also provide a username. The example below sets up a client object (we'll simply call it `client`) that connects
to Riak on `localhost` and on port 8087, specifies `riakuser` as a
username, and points the client to a CA located at
`/ssl_dir/cacertfile.pem`.

```ruby
require 'riak'

client = Riak::Client.new(
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  pb_port: 8087,
  authentication: {
    ca_file: '/ssl_dir/cacertfile.pem',
    user: 'riakuser'
  }
)
```

This client object is currently not set up to use any of the available
security sources, except trust-based auth, provided that the CIDR from
which the client is connecting has been specified as trusted. More on
this in [Trust-based Authentication]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/3.2.0/using/security/managing-sources/#trust-based-authentication).

## Password-based Authentication

To enable our client to use password-based auth, we can use most of the
information from the example above, with the exception that we will
specify a password for the client in the `authentication` hash. We'll
use the password `rosebud` here and in the rest of the examples.

```ruby
client = Riak::Client.new(
  # Using the host and pb_port from above
  authentication: {
    ca_file: '/ssl_dir/cacertfile.pem',
    user: 'riakuser',
    password: 'rosebud'
  }
)
```

## PAM-based Authentication

If you have specified that a specific client be authenticated using
[PAM]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/3.2.0/using/security/managing-sources/#pam-based-authentication), you will
need to provide a CA as well as the username and password that you
specified when creating the user in Riak. For more, see our
documentation on [User Management]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/3.2.0/using/security/basics#user-management).

## Certificate-based Authentication

Using certificate-based authentication requires us to specify the
location of a CA (as with all security sources), a username, a
client-specific CA, a CA-generated cert, and a private key. We'll assume
that all certs are stored in `/ssl_dir`, as in the previous examples.

```ruby
client = Riak::Client.new(
  # Using the host and pb_port from above
  authentication: {
    ca_file: '/path/to/cacertfile.pem',
    user: 'riakuser',
    client_ca: '/path/to/client_cert.pem',
    cert: '/path/to/cert.pem',
    key: '/path/to/key.pem'
  }
)
```

The `client_ca` must be specified if you intend to use a CA that is
different from the CA used by Riak, e.g. if you are integrating with
an existing single sign-on (SSO) system. If the client and server CA are
the same, you don't need to specify `client_ca`. The client cert and
key, however, must always be specified.

The `client_ca`, `cert`, and `key` fields are all flexible in their
usage. You can use a string specifying a filename (as in the example
above), or you can pass in an appropriate OpenSSL object, e.g. an SSL
object created using the
[OpenSSL](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL.html)
gem. If you use specify filenames, those files will be loaded and
converted into the appropriate OpenSSL object.

## Specifying a Certificate Revocation List

If you create certificates specifying a CA-signed Certificate Revocation
List (CRL), those certs will be checked against the CRLs specified. You
can specify the location of the list in the `authentication` hash:

```ruby
client = Riak::Client.new(
  # Using the host and pb_port from above
  authentication: {
    ca_file: '/ssl_dir/cacertfile.pem',
    user: 'riakuser',
    # Using the cert paths from above
    crl_file: '/ssl_dir/revocation.crl'
  }
)
```

CRL checking can sometimes be a slow process. To disable it, you can set
`crl` to `false` in the `authentication` hash when instantiating your
client object.

## Online Certificate Status Protocol

If you create certificates with a specified Online Certificate Status
Protocol
([OCSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol)),
the OCSP endpoint will automatically be checked. If that endpoint is not
available or if checking is running slowly, you can disable OCSP
checking by setting `ocsp` to `false` in the `authentication` hash.
