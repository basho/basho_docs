Sets bucket properties like "n_val" and "allow_mult".

## Request

```bash
PUT /buckets/bucket/props
```

Important headers:

* `Content-Type` - `application/json`

The body of the request should be a JSON object with a single entry "props".
Unmodified bucket properties may be omitted.

Available properties:

* `n_val` (integer > 0) - the number of replicas for objects in this bucket
* `allow_mult` (true or false) - whether to allow sibling objects to be created
(concurrent updates)
* `last_write_wins` (true or false) - whether to ignore object history (vector
clock) when writing
* `precommit` - [precommit hooks]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.8/developing/usage/commit-hooks)
* `postcommit` - [postcommit hooks]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.8/developing/usage/commit-hooks)
* `r, w, dw, rw` - default quorum values for operations on keys in the bucket.
Valid values are:
  * `"all"` - all nodes must respond
  * `"quorum"` - (n_val/2) + 1 nodes must respond. *This is the default.*
  * `"one"` - equivalent to 1
  * *Any integer* - must be less than or equal to n_val
* `backend` - when using `riak_kv_multi_backend`, which named backend to use for
the bucket

Other properties do exist but are not commonly modified.

{{% note title="Property types" %}}
Make sure you use the proper types for attributes like **n_val** and
**allow_mult**. If you use strings instead of integers and booleans
respectively, you may see some odd errors in your logs, saying something like
`"{badarith,[{riak_kv_util,normalize_rw_value,2},]}"`.

## Response

Normal status codes:

* `204 No Content`

Typical error codes:

* `400 Bad Request` - if the submitted JSON is invalid
* `415 Unsupported Media Type` - if the Content-Type was not set to
application/json in the request

If successful, no content will be returned in the response body.
