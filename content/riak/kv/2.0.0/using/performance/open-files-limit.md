[plan backend bitcask]: {{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.0/setup/planning/backend/bitcask

Riak can consume a large number of open file handles during normal
operation. The [Bitcask][plan backend bitcask] backend in particular may accumulate a high
number of data files before it has a chance to run a merge process. You
can count the number of data files in the Bitcask directory with
following command:

```bash
ls data/bitcask/*/* | wc -l
```

Please note that the creation of numerous data files is normal. Each
time Riak is started, Bitcask creates a new data file per partition;
once in a while, Bitcask will merge a collection of data files into a
single file to avoid accumulating file handles. It’s possible to
artificially inflate the number of file handles Bitcask uses by
repeatedly writing data and restarting Riak. The shell command below
illustrates this issue:

```bash
for i in {1..100}
  do
    riak stop
    riak start
    sleep 3
    curl http://localhost:8098/riak/test -X POST -d "x" \
      -H "Content-Type: text/plain"
    ls data/bitcask/*/* | wc -l
done
```

## Changing the limit

Most operating systems can change the open-files limit using the `ulimit
-n` command. Example:

```bash
ulimit -n 200000
```

However, this only changes the limit for the **current shell session**.
Changing the limit on a system-wide, permanent basis varies more between
systems.

## Linux

On most Linux distributions, the total limit for open files is
controlled by `sysctl`.

```bash
sysctl fs.file-max
fs.file-max = 200000
```

As seen above, it is generally set high enough for Riak. If you have
other things running on the system, you might want to consult the
[sysctl manpage](http://linux.die.net/man/8/sysctl) for how to change
that setting. However, what most needs to be changed is the per-user
open files limit. This requires editing `/etc/security/limits.conf`, for
which you'll need superuser access. If you installed Riak from a binary
package, add lines for the `riak` user like so, substituting your
desired hard and soft limits:

```config
riak soft nofile 65536
riak hard nofile 200000
```

On Ubuntu, if you’re always relying on the init scripts to start Riak,
you can create the file `/etc/default/riak` and specify a manual limit
like so:

```bash
ulimit -n 200000
```

This file is automatically sourced from the init script, and the Riak
process started by it will properly inherit this setting. As init
scripts are always run as the root user, there’s no need to specifically
set limits in `/etc/security/limits.conf` if you’re solely relying on
init scripts.

On CentOS/RedHat systems, make sure to set a proper limit for the user
you’re usually logging in with to do any kind of work on the machine,
including managing Riak. On CentOS, `sudo` properly inherits the values
from the executing user.

### Enable PAM-Based Limits for Debian & Ubuntu

It can be helpful to enable PAM user limits so that non-root users, such
as the `riak` user, may specify a higher value for maximum open files.
For example, follow these steps to enable PAM user limits and set the
soft and hard values *for all users of the system* to allow for up to
*65536* open files.

1\.  Edit `/etc/pam.d/common-session` and append the following line:

```config
session    required   pam_limits.so
```

2\. Save and close the file.  If `/etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive` exists, append the same line as above.

3\. Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` and append the following lines to the
file:

```bash
soft     nofile          65536
hard     nofile          65536
```

4\. Save and close the file.

5\. (optional) If you will be accessing the Riak nodes via secure shell
(ssh), you should also edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and uncomment the
following line:

```config
#UseLogin no
```

and set its value to `yes` as shown here:

```config
UseLogin yes
```

6\. Restart the machine so that the limits to take effect and verify that
the new limits are set with the following command:

```bash
ulimit -a
```

### Enable PAM-Based Limits for CentOS and Red Hat

1\. Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` and append the following lines to
the file:

```bash
soft     nofile          200000
hard     nofile          200000
```

2\. Save and close the file.

3\. Restart the machine so that the limits to take effect and verify that
the new limits are set with the following command:

```bash
ulimit -a
```

{{% note %}}
In the above examples, the open files limit is raised for all users of the system. If you prefer, the limit can be specified for the riak user only by substituting the two asterisks (`*`) in the examples with `riak`.
{{% /note %}}

## Solaris

In Solaris 8, there is a default limit of 1024 file descriptors per
process. In Solaris 9, the default limit was raised to 65536. To
increase the per-process limit on Solaris, add the following line to
`/etc/system`:

```config
set rlim_fd_max=200000
```

[Reference](http://blogs.oracle.com/elving/entry/too_many_open_files)

## Mac OS X

To check the current limits on your Mac OS X system, run:

```bash
launchctl limit maxfiles
```

The last two columns are the soft and hard limits, respectively.

### Adjusting Open File Limits in Yosemite

To adjust open files limits on a system-wide basis in Mac OS X Yosemite,
you must create two configuration files. The first is a property list
(aka plist) file in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist` that
contains the following XML configuration:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
  <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
      <key>Label</key>
        <string>limit.maxfiles</string>
      <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
          <string>launchctl</string>
          <string>limit</string>
          <string>maxfiles</string>
          <string>200000</string>
          <string>200000</string>
        </array>
      <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>
      <key>ServiceIPC</key>
        <false/>
    </dict>
  </plist>
```

This will set the open files limit to 200000. The second plist
configuration file should be stored in
`/Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxproc.plist` with the following
contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple/DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
  <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
      <key>Label</key>
        <string>limit.maxproc</string>
      <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
          <string>launchctl</string>
          <string>limit</string>
          <string>maxproc</string>
          <string>2048</string>
          <string>2048</string>
        </array>
      <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true />
      <key>ServiceIPC</key>
        <false />
    </dict>
  </plist>
```

Both plist files must be owned by `root:wheel` and have permissions
`-rw-r--r--`. This permissions _should_ be in place by default, but you
can ensure that they are in place by running `sudo chmod 644
<filename>`. While the steps explained above will cause system-wide open
file limits to be correctly set upon restart, you can apply them
manually by running `launchctl limit`.

In addition to setting these limits at the system level, we recommend
setting the at the session level as well by appending the following
lines to your `bashrc`, `bashprofile`, or analogous file:

```bash
ulimit -n 200000
ulimit -u 2048
```

Like the plist files, your `bashrc` or similar file should have
`-rw-r--r--` permissions. At this point, you can restart your computer
and enter `ulimit -n` into your terminal. If your system is configured
correctly, you should see that `maxfiles` has been set to 200000.

### Adjusting Open File Limits in Older Versions of OS X

To adjust the maximum open file limits in OS X 10.7 (Lion) up to but not
including OS X Yosemite, edit `/etc/launchd.conf` and increase the
limits for both values as appropriate.

For example, to set the soft limit to 16384 files, and the hard limit to
32768 files, perform the following steps:

1. Verify current limits:

    ```bash
    launchctl limit
    ```

    The response output should look something like this:

    ```
    cpu         unlimited      unlimited
    filesize    unlimited      unlimited
    data        unlimited      unlimited
    stack       8388608        67104768
    core        0              unlimited
    rss         unlimited      unlimited
    memlock     unlimited      unlimited
    maxproc     709            1064
    maxfiles    10240          10240
    ```

2. Edit (or create) `/etc/launchd.conf` and increase the limits. Add
lines that look like the following (using values appropriate to your
environment):

    ```bash
    limit maxfiles 16384 32768
    ```

3. Save the file, and restart the system for the new limits to take
effect. After restarting, verify the new limits with the launchctl limit
command:

    ```bash
    launchctl limit
    ```

    The response output should look something like this:

    ```
    cpu         unlimited      unlimited
    filesize    unlimited      unlimited
    data        unlimited      unlimited
    stack       8388608        67104768
    core        0              unlimited
    rss         unlimited      unlimited
    memlock     unlimited      unlimited
    maxproc     709            1064
    maxfiles    16384          32768
    ```
