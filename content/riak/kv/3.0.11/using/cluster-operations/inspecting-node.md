When inspection of a Riak node to gather metrics on performance or
potential issues is desired, a number of tools are available to help,
and are either included with Riak itself or made available through the
Riak community.

This guide provides starting points and details on some of the available
tools for inspecting a Riak node.

## riak admin status

`riak admin status` is a subcommand of the `riak admin` command that is
included with every installation of Riak. The `status` subcommand
provides data related to the current operating status for a node. The
output of `riak admin status` is categorized and detailed below.

Please note, for some counters, such as `node_get_fsm_objsize`, a
minimum of 5 transactions is required for statistics to be generated.

#### Performance

We recommended checking stats every 90-120 seconds for best performance.

Repeated runs of the `riak admin status` command should not have a
negative performance impact as the statistics are cached internally in
Riak.

### Active Stats

Active Stats represent current activity on the node.

Stat                    | Description
------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
`pbc_active`            | Number of active Protocol Buffers connections
`node_get_fsm_active`   | Number of active GET FSMs
`node_put_fsm_active`   | Number of active PUT FSMs
`index_fsm_active`      | Number of active Secondary Index FSMs
`list_fsm_active`       | Number of active Keylisting FSMs
`node_get_fsm_rejected` | Number of GET FSMs actively being rejected by Sidejob's overload protection
`node_put_fsm_rejected` | Number of PUT FSMs actively being rejected by Sidejob's overload protection

### Average Stats

Average Stats represent an average calculated as (total occurrences /
number of samples) since this node was started.  In the below stats the
sample time is 1s, giving us a per-second average.  Currently, the only
Average Stats are reported by Sidejob - an Erlang library that
implements a parallel, capacity-limited request pool.

Stat                    | Description
------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
`node_get_fsm_in_rate`  | Average number of GET FSMs enqueued by Sidejob
`node_get_fsm_out_rate` | Average number of GET FSMs dequeued by Sidejob
`node_put_fsm_in_rate`  | Average number of PUT FSMs enqueued by Sidejob
`node_put_fsm_out_rate` | Average number of PUT FSMs dequeued by Sidejob

### One-Minute Stats

occurred within the last minute on this node.

general node health. From your application's perspective, FSM Time
effectively represents experienced latency. Mean, Median, and 95th-,
99th-, and 100th-percentile (Max) counters are displayed. These are
one-minute stats.

## `riak-debug`

The `riak-debug` command is used to identify and diagnose common problems with your Riak KV nodes.

`riak-debug` also runs `riak admin diag`, which runs a small suite of diagnostic checks against a Riak KV node to discover common problems. It often offers recommendations about how to resolve those problems as well.

{{% note title="Warning about `riak-debug` and `riak admin diag` usage" %}}
The `riak-debug` and `riak admin diag` commands should only be used after a new installation or configuration change. It should not be used as part of regular monitoring. Overuse of `riak-debug` or `riak admin diag` can eventually cause the node to crash from atom table exhaustion.
In addition, overuse of `riak-debug` and `riak admin diag` can lead to overloads in unhealthy nodes. These commands should be used sparingly and not used in the course of normal monitoring.

## riak admin diag

Running `riak admin diag` by itself will perform a check of all of the
data partitions in your cluster. It will return a listing of partitions
that have been checked, each of which looks something like this:

```
{1393.0.1148081016843912887106182707253109560705024, % the partition checked
 'dev-rel@127.0.0.1'},                              % that partition's nodename
```

At the end of that (potentially very long) listing of checked
partitions, it will print notices, warnings, and other pieces of
information about issues that it has found, including date/time, message
type, and a detailed description. Here's an example:

```
15:34:52.736 [warning] Riak crashed at Wed, 07 Dec 2011 21:47:50 GMT, leaving crash dump in /srv/riak/log/erl_crash.dump. Please inspect or remove the file.
15:34:52.736 [notice] Data directory /srv/riak/data/bitcask is not mounted with 'noatime'. Please remount its disk with the 'noatime' flag to improve performance.
```

Messages bear the following types (derived from
[syslog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) security levels):

* `debug`
* `info`
* `notice`
* `warning`
* `error`
* `critical`
* `alert`
* `emergency`

#### Command flags

Attaching the `--help` flag will return a list of flags and commands
that can be used with Riaknostic:

```
Usage: riak admin diag [-d <level>] [-l] [-h] [--export] [check_name ...]

-h, --help            Display help/usage dialogue
-d, --level           Minimum message severity level (default: notice)
-l, --list            Describe available diagnostic tasks
--export              Package system info in '/export.zip'
check_name            A specific check to run
```

Running `riak admin diag`  with the `--list` flag will return a list of
available diagnostic checks. The following checks are available:

Check | Description
:-----|:-----------
`disk` | Data directory permissions and atime
`dumps` | Find crash dumps
`memory_use` | Measure memory usage
`nodes_connected` | Cluster node liveness
`ring_membership` | Cluster membership validity
`ring_preflists` | Check if the ring satisfies `n_val`
`ring_size` | Check if the ring size valid

The `--level` flag enables you to specify the log level and thus to
filter messages based on type. You can pass in any of the message types
listed above (`debug`, `info`, etc.).

The `--level` flag can be used when running `riak admin diag` with or
without specifying a diagnostic check.

#### Contributing

Do you have an idea that would help us improve Riaknostic? If so, fork
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/basho/riaknostic) and send us
a pull request with your changes. The code is documented with
[edoc](http://riaknostic.basho.com/edoc/index.html), so give the API
Docs a read before you contribute.

If you want to run the Riaknostic script while developing and you don't
have it hooked up to your local Riak installation, you can invoke it
directly like so:

```bash
./riaknostic --etc ~/code/riak/rel/riak/etc --base ~/code/riak/rel/riak --user `whoami` [other options]
```

Those extra options are usually assigned by the `riak admin` script for
you, but here's how to set them:

* `--etc` - The location of your Riak configuration directory (usually
    `/etc`). In the example above, configuration is in the generated
    directory of a source checkout of Riak.
* `--base` - The "base" directory of Riak, usually the root of the
    generated directory or `/usr/lib/riak` on Linux. Scan the
    `riak admin` script for how the `RUNNER_BASE_DIR` variable is
    assigned on your platform.
* `--user` - The user/UID as which the Riak node runs. In a source
    checkout, it's the current user; on most systems, it's `riak`.
