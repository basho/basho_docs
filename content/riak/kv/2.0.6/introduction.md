Riak version 2.0 includes deep changes and many new features affecting
all facets of Riak. This article gives an overview of the new features
and where you can learn more about using them in your Riak installation.

For more in-depth implementation details check out the
[version 2.0 release notes](https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/riak-2.0.0/RELEASE-NOTES.md).

If you're upgrading to Riak 2.0 from an earlier version, please be aware
that all of the new features listed below are optional:

* **Riak Data Types** --- Riak's new CRDT-based [Data Types]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/data-types) can
  simplify modeling data in Riak, but are only used in buckets
  explicitly configured to use them.
* **Strong Consistency, Riak Security, and the New Riak Search** ---
  These are subsystems in Riak that must be explicitly turned on to
  work. If not turned on, they will have no impact on performance.
  Furthermore, the older Riak Search will continue to be included with
  Riak.
* **Security** --- [Authentication and authorization]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/using/security/basics) can be enabled
  or disabled at any time.
* **Configuration management** --- Riak's [configuration files]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/configuring/reference/) have
  been streamlined into a single file named `riak.conf`. If you are
  upgrading, however, your existing `app.config` and `vm.args` files
  will still be recognized in version 2.0.
* **Bucket Types** --- While we strongly recommend [using bucket types]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/using/reference/bucket-types) when creating new buckets, they are not required.
* **Dotted Version Vectors (DVVs)** --- This alternative to traditional
  [vector clocks]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/learn/concepts/causal-context/#vector-clocks) is enabled by default
  in all [bucket types]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/using/reference/bucket-types), but DVVs can be disabled
  by setting the `dvv_enabled` property to `false` on any bucket type.

In a nutshell, upgrading to 2.0 will change how you use Riak only if you
want it to. But even if you don't plan on using the new features, there
are a number of improvements that make upgrading a good choice,
including the following:

* [Cluster metadata]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/app-guide/cluster-metadata) --- This is a subsystem of Riak added in 2.0 that
  reduces the amount of inter-node gossip in Riak clusters, which can
  reduce network congestion.
* [Active Anti-Entropy]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/learn/glossary/#active-anti-entropy-aae) --- While Riak has had an Active Anti-Entropy
  (AAE) feature that is turned on by default since version 1.3, AAE
  performance has been improved in version 2.0.
* [Bug patches](https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/2.0/RELEASE-NOTES.md)
  --- A variety of bugs present in earlier versions have been identified
  and patched.

More on upgrading can be found in our [Riak 2.0 upgrade guide]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/setup/upgrading/version).

## Riak Data Types

In distributed systems there is an unavoidable trade-off between
consistency and availability. This can complicate some aspects of
application design if you're using Riak as a key/value store because the
application is responsible for resolving conflicts between replicas of
objects stored in different Riak nodes.

Riak 2.0 offers a new approach to this problem for a wide range of use
cases in the form of [Riak Data Types]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/data-types). Instead of
forcing the application to resolve conflicts, Riak offers five Data
Types that can reduce some of the complexities of developing using
Riak: [flags]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/data-types/maps#flags), [registers]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/data-types/maps#registers),
[counters]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/data-types/counters), [sets]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/data-types/sets), and
[maps]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/data-types/maps).

#### Relevant Docs

* [Using Data Types]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/data-types) explains how to use Riak Data Types on the
  application side, with usage examples for all five Data Types in all
  of Basho's officially supported clients (Java, Ruby, Python, .NET and
  Erlang) and for Riak's HTTP interface.
* [Data Types]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/data-types) explains some of the theoretical concerns that drive
  Riak Data Types and shares details about how they are implemented
  in Riak.

## Riak Search 2.0 (codename: Yokozuna)

Riak Search 2.0 is a complete, top-to-bottom replacement for Riak
Search, integrating Riak with [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/)'s full-text search capabilities and supporting Solr's client query APIs.

#### Relevant Docs

* [Using Search]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/usage/search) provides an overview of how to use the new
  Riak Search.
* [Search Schema]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/usage/search-schemas) shows you how to create and manage custom search
  schemas.
* [Search Details]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/using/reference/search) provides an in-depth look at the design
  considerations that went into the new Riak Search.

## Strong Consistency

Riak is typically known as an AP system, favoring high availability and
partition tolerance while sacrificing data consistency. In version 2.0,
you have the option of applying strong consistency guarantees and thus
of using Riak as a CP---consistent plus partition-tolerant---system for
some (or perhaps all) of your data.

#### Relevant Docs

* [Using Strong Consistency]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/using/cluster-operations/strong-consistency) shows you how to enable Riak's strong
  consistency subsystem and to apply strong consistency guarantees to
  data stored in specified buckets.
* [Strong Consistency]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/using/reference/strong-consistency) provides a theoretical treatment of how a
  strongly consistent system differs from an [eventually consistent]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/learn/concepts/eventual-consistency) system, as well as details about how
  strong consistency is implemented in Riak.
* [Managing Strong Consistency]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/configuring/strong-consistency) is a guide to strong consistency for
  Riak operators.

engineer [Joseph Blomstedt](https://github.com/jtuple). You should also
check out [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXJxbhca5Xg).

## Security

Riak 2.0 enables you to manage:

* **Authorization** to perform specific tasks, from GETs and PUTs to
running MapReduce jobs to administering Riak Search.

* **Authentication** of Riak clients seeking access to Riak.

Previously, securing Riak was restricted to the network level.
Now, security measures can be applied to the internals of
Riak itself and managed through a simple command-line interface.

#### Relevant Docs

* [Authentication and Authorization]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/using/security/basics) explains how Riak Security can be
  enabled and disabled, how users and groups are managed, how
  authorization to perform certain operations can be granted and
  revoked, how security ciphers can be chosen, and more.
* [Managing Security Sources]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/using/security/managing-sources/) is an in-depth tutorial on how to
  implement Riak's four supported authentication sources: trusted
  networks, passwords, pluggable authentication modules, and
  certificates.

## Simplified Configuration Management

In older versions of Riak, a Riak node's configuration was determined by
two separate files: `app.config` and `vm.args`. In Riak 2.0, you have
the option of either continuing to use these files, which can be useful
if you're upgrading to 2.0, or to manage configuration through a single
`riak.conf` file in which parameters are set using the following syntax:

```riakconf
parameter.sub-parameter = setting
```

Based on Basho's [Cuttlefish](https://github.com/basho/cuttlefish)
project, the new system is much simpler, leaving behind the Erlang
syntax required in `app.config`.

{{% note title="Note on upgrading" %}}
Version 2.0 will support both the old and the new configuration system, in
case you're upgrading. Please note, however, that if you use both systems side
by side, all settings from the older, `app.config`/`vm.args`-based system will
override any settings from the new system.
{{% /note %}}

#### Relevant Docs

* [Configuration Files]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/configuring/reference/) lists and describes all of the configurable
  parameters available in Riak 2.0, from configuring your chosen storage
  backend(s) to setting default bucket properties to controlling Riak's
  logging system and much more.

## Bucket Types

In older versions of Riak, bucket properties were managed on a
bucket-by-bucket, ad hoc basis. With bucket types, you can create,
manage, and apply whole configurations of bucket properties efficiently.
Bucket types also act as a third namespace in addition to buckets
and keys.

#### Relevant Docs

* [Using Bucket Types]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/using/reference/bucket-types) explains how to create, modify, and activate
  bucket types, as well as how the new system differs from the older,
  bucket properties-based system.

## Dotted Version Vectors

In prior versions of Riak, [conflict resolution]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/usage/conflict-resolution) was managed using
[vector clocks]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/learn/concepts/causal-context/#vector-clocks), which track object update causality.

Riak 2.0 has added support for dotted version vectors (DVVs).
DVVs serve an analogous role to vector
clocks but are more effective at containing [sibling explosion]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/learn/concepts/causal-context/#sibling-explosion) and can reduce Riak cluster latency.

#### Relevant Docs

* [Dotted Version Vectors]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/learn/concepts/causal-context/#dotted-version-vectors) explains some of the theoretical nuances behind the distinction between DVVs and vector clocks and offers instructions on implementing DVVs.

## New Client Libraries

While Basho offered official [client libraries]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.0.6/developing/client-libraries) for Java, Ruby,
Python, .NET and Erlang for versions of Riak prior to 2.0, all clients
have undergone major changes in anticipation of the 2.0 release.
