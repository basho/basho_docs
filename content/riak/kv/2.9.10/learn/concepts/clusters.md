Riak's default mode of operation is to work as a cluster consisting of
multiple [nodes][glossary node], i.e. multiple well-connected data
hosts.

Each host in the cluster runs a single instance of Riak, referred to as
a Riak node. Each Riak node manages a set of virtual nodes, or
[vnodes][glossary vnode], that are responsible for storing a
separate portion of the keys stored in the cluster.

In contrast to some high-availability systems, Riak nodes are _not_
clones of one another, and they do not all participate in fulfilling
every request. Instead, you can configure, at runtime or at request
time, the number of nodes on which data is to be replicated, as well as
when [replication][concept replication] occurs and which [merge strategy][usage conflict resolution] and failure model are to be followed.

## The Ring

Though much of this section is discussed in our annotated discussion of
the Amazon [Dynamo paper][learn dynamo], it nonetheless provides a summary of
how Riak implements the distribution of data throughout a cluster.

Any client interface to Riak interacts with objects in terms of the
[bucket][concept buckets] and [key][concept keys objects] in which a value is
stored, as well as the [bucket type][usage bucket types] that is used
to set the bucket's properties.

Internally, Riak computes a 160-bit binary hash of each bucket/key pair
and maps this value to a position on an ordered **ring** of all such
values. This ring is divided into partitions, with each Riak vnode
responsible for one of these partitions (we say that each vnode
_claims_ that partition).

Below is a visual representation of a Riak ring:

![A Riak Ring]({{<baseurl>}}images/riak-ring.png)

The nodes of a Riak cluster each attempt to run a roughly equal number
of vnodes at any given time. In the general case, this means that each
node in the cluster is responsible for 1/(number of nodes) of the ring,
or (number of partitions)/(number of nodes) vnodes.

If two nodes define a 16-partition cluster, for example, then each node
will run 8 vnodes. Nodes attempt to claim their partitions at intervals
around the ring such that there is an even distribution amongst the
member nodes and that no node is responsible for more than one replica
of a key.

## Intelligent Replication

When an object is being stored in the cluster, any node may participate
as the **coordinating node** for the request. The coordinating node
consults the ring state to determine which vnode owns the partition in
which the value's key belongs, then sends the write request to that
vnode as well as to the vnodes responsible for the next N-1 partitions
in the ring (where N is a [configurable parameter][usage replication] that describes how many copies of the value to store). The
write request may also specify that at least W (=< N) of those vnodes
reply with success, and that DW (=< W) reply with success only after
durably storing the value.

A read, or GET, request operates similarly, sending requests to the
vnode  that "claims" the partition in which the key resides, as well as
to the next N-1 partitions. The request also specifies R (=< N), the
number of vnodes that must reply before a response is returned.

Here is an illustration of this process:

![A Riak Ring]({{<baseurl>}}images/riak-data-distribution.png)

When N is set to 3, the value `REM` is stored in the key `artist`. That
key is assigned to 3 partitions out of 32 available partitions. When a
read request is made to Riak, the ring state will be used to determine
which partitions are responsible. From there, a variety of
[configurable parameters][usage replication] determine how Riak
will behave in case the value is not immediately found.

## Gossiping

The ring state is shared around the cluster by means of a "gossip
protocol." Whenever a node changes its claim on the ring, it announces,
i.e. "gossips," this change to other nodes so that the other nodes can
respond appropriately. Nodes also periodically re-announce what they
know about ring in case any nodes happened to miss previous updates.
