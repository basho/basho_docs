{{% note title="Deprecation notice" %}}
The use of client IDs in conflict resolution is now deprecated in Riak. If you
are building or maintaining a Riak client that is intended to be compatible
with Riak 1.4 or later, you can safely ignore client IDs.
{{% /note %}}

Set the client ID for this connection. A library may want to set the
client ID if it has a good way to uniquely identify actors across
reconnects. This will reduce vector clock bloat.

## Request
