Reads the bucket or bucket type properties.

## Request

```bash
GET /buckets/bucket/props
```

Or, to read bucket properties from a bucket in a bucket type:

```bash
GET /types/type/buckets/bucket/props
```

Optional query parameters (only valid for the old format):

* `props` - whether to return the bucket properties (`true` is the default)
* `keys` - whether to return the keys stored in the bucket. (`false` is the
default). See also [HTTP List Keys]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.10/developing/api/http/list-keys).

## Response

Normal status codes:

* `200 OK`

Important headers:

* `Content-Type` - `application/json`

The JSON object in the response will contain up to two entries, `"props"` and
`"keys"`, which are present or missing, according to the optional query
parameters.  The default is for only `"props"` to be present.

See [HTTP Set Bucket Properties]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.10/developing/api/http/set-bucket-props) for more information about the available
bucket properties. See [Managing Bucket Types Through the Command Line]({{< baseurl >}}riak/kv/2.9.10/using/reference/bucket-types/#managing-bucket-types-through-the-command-line) for more details about reading bucket types using  the `riak-admin bucket-type` interface.
