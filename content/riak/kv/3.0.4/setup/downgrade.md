Downgrades of Riak KV are tested and supported for two feature release versions, with the general procedure being similar to that of a [rolling upgrade][rolling upgrade].

Depending on the versions involved in the downgrade, there are additional steps to be performed before, during, and after the upgrade on on each node. These steps are related to changes or new features that are not present in the downgraded version.

## Overview

For every node in the cluster:

1. Stop Riak KV.
2. Back up Riak's `etc` and `data` directories.
3. Downgrade the Riak KV.
4. Remove Riak temporary data.
5. Reconfigure Solr cores.
6. Start Riak KV.
7. Monitor the reindex of the data.
8. Finalize process and restart Riak KV.

### Guidelines

* Riak control should be disabled throughout the rolling downgrade process.
* [Configuration Files][config ref] must be replaced with those of the version being downgraded to.

### Components That Complicate Downgrades

### When Downgrading is No Longer an Option

If you enabled LZ4 compression in LevelDB and/or enabled global expiration in LevelDB when you installed KV 3.0.4, you cannot downgrade.

## General Process

{{% note %}}
While the cluster contains mixed version members, if you have not set the cluster to use the legacy AAE tree format, you will see the `bad_version` error emitted to the log any time nodes with differing versions attempt to exchange AAE data (including AAE fullsync).

This is benign and similar to the `not_built` and `already_locked` errors which can be seen during normal AAE operation. These events will stop once the downgrade is complete.

### Stop Riak KV and remove temporary data

1\. Stop Riak KV:

```bash
riak stop
```
2\. Back up your Riak KV /etc and /data directories:

```bash
sudo tar -czf riak_backup.tar.gz /var/lib/riak /etc/riak
```

3\. Downgrade Riak KV:

```RHEL/CentOS
sudo rpm -Uvh »riak_package_name«.rpm
```

```Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i »riak_package_name«.deb
```

4\. Remove the AAE data:
