Performs a [Riak KV Search]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.4/developing/usage/search) query.

## Request

```
GET /search/query/<index_name>
```

## Optional Query Parameters

* `wt`
---
The [response
    writer](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Response+Writers)
    to be used when returning the Search payload. The currently
    available options are `json` and `xml`. The default is `xml`.
* `q`
---
The actual Search query itself. Examples can be found in
    [Using Search]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.4/developing/usage/search). If a query is not specified, Riak will return
    information about the index itself, e.g. the number of documents
    indexed.

## Normal Response Codes

* `200 OK`

## Typical Error Codes

* `400 Bad Request`
---
Returned when, for example, a malformed query is
    supplied
* `404 Object Not Found`
---
Returned if the Search index you are
    attempting to query does not exist
* `503 Service Unavailable`
---
The request timed out internally

## Response

If a `200 OK` is returned, then the Search query has been successful.
Below is an example JSON response from querying an index that currently
has no documents associated with it:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "docs": [],
    "maxScore": 0.0,
    "numFound": 0,
    "start": 0
  },
  "responseHeader": {
    "status": 0,
    "QTime": 10,
    "params": { /* internal info from the query */ }
  }
}
```
