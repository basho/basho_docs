## Changes

* Improve AAE fullsync by estimating total number of keys. This allows
    for better sizing of the bloom filter when performing a
    bloom-fold-based exchange and enhances the adaptive exchange logic
    that was added previously in Riak 2.0.1. In that version, the new
    `riak_repl.fullsync_direct_percentage_limit` setting was added,
    which allowed the limit to be specified as a percentage of total
    keys rather than as a fixed number.

## AAE Fullsync Performance Improvements

In version 2.0.4, a number of improvements to the AAE fullsync feature
were added, improvements that were initially introduced in Riak version
1.4.12 but had not yet been introduced into Riak 2.0.x. The following
improvements have been introduced:

* Data transfers are now pipelined instead of individually acknowledged,
    in the name of maximizing throughput
* The code now avoids redundant scans of replcated data. For a
    replication factor of, say, 3 (i.e. an `n_val` of 3), only a third
    of the relevant vnodes are scanned.
* The algorithm is now smarter about small differences

Performing an AAE fullsync operation between two identical clusters is
very fast. The time it takes to finish an AAE fullsync is much closer to
linear on the number of differences between the clusters. Below are the
results of one of our benchmarks. Two 8-node clusters were used, each
with the following characteristics:

* Each node has 630 GB of SSD storage
* Each node is running only two vnodes (16-partition ring)
* 23 million objects per vnode
* 99% of objects are 8 KB
* 1% of objects are a mix of 8 KB to 40 MB outliers
* 450 GB of data on disk per server

The results for each stage of fullsync:

* Empty cluster to empty cluster: 6 seconds
* Full cluster to empty cluster: 14 hours, 40 minutes
* 10% changes: 3 hours, 45 minutes
* 1% changes: 40.5 minutes
* No changes: 42.5 seconds

* Avoid SSL deadlocks that occur when sending data bidirectionally using
    Erlang SSL sockets. The fix is a patch to the Erlang VM shipped with
    the build.
