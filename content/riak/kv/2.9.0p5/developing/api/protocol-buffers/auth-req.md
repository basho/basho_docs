Sends a username (`user`) and password (`password`) to Riak as part of
an authentication request. Both values are sent as binaries.

## Request

```protobuf
message RpbAuthReq {
    required bytes user = 1;
    required bytes password = 2;
}
```

For more on authentication, see our documentation on [Authentication and Authorization]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.9.0p5/using/security/basics).
