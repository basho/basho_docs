## Overview

## Release Schedule

April 2018 saw the release of [Riak KV 2.2.6](https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/riak-2.2.6/RELEASE-NOTES.md), the first [post-Basho](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/07/31/end_of_the_road_for_basho_as_court_puts_biz_into_receivership/) release of the Riak KV store.  This release was deliberately light on features, focusing on stability fixes that could be added with minimal disruption to the existing codebase and minimal risk to existing production workloads.  The release did though establish a smoother path to releasing future changes, by investing significant effort in improving the reliability and usability of the Riak test and release process.

There is now a plan for significant further improvements to Riak.  These improvements will be delivered in two release cycles - Release 2.9 and Release 3.0:

- Release 2.9 is focused on delivering significant database throughput improvements for use-cases which depend on both ordered keys and mid-to-large size objects, an overhaul of the efficiency of managing anti-entropy both within and across database clusters, and reductions in the network-overheads of running a Riak cluster.

- Release 3.0 is focused on providing a future-proof Riak, migrating to an up-to-date OTP platform, and stripping away the accidental complexity of under-used features.  Release 3.0 will also build on some of the foundation improvements in Riak 2.9, to provide for a more efficient and flexible replication solution, and allow for a richer set of query features that can be run at minimal risk to the predictability of performance for the core Key/Value workloads of Riak customers.

Release 2.9 will have an initial private release candidate available in early December 2018, and the release is expected to be generally available by the end of January 2019.  The target for Release 3.0 is to have an initial Release Candidate available in April 2019.

Release 2.9 is intended to be a stepping stone towards migrating to Release 3.0, but for users of features that will be terminated in Release 3.0, it is possible that community-led updates may continue on the 2.9 release branch for some time beyond the availability of Release 3.0.

## Improvements

Release 2.9 also brings three building blocks to enable current and future improvements to the management of operational risk:

#### Vnode Soft Limits

- When Riak is in receipt of a PUT request, it must select a vnode to co-ordinate the PUT. However, when load is high, vnodes may have work queues of varying sizes - and picking a vnode with a large queue will slow the PUT to the pace of that slow vnode. Vnode soft limits are a resolution to this problem, providing a simple check of the sate of a vnode queue before determining that a particular vnode is a good candidate to coordinate a given PUT.

- The biggest advantage seen in testing vnode soft limits is with the leveldb backend, where under soak test conditions there is a 50% reduction in the trend-line of 99th percentile PUT measure, and a 80% reduction in the peak 99th percentile PUT time.

#### Core node worker pool

- Riak-backed applications tend to make heavy use of the standard GET/PUT KV operations. These are short-lived tasks, but sometimes longer-lives tasks are required to either provide information to the operator (e.g. what is the average object size in the store?), or detect otherwise hidden errors (e.g. AAE tree rebuilds). Each such task has tended to evolve its own mechanism to ensure that the impact of the task can be controlled to avoid inhibiting higher priority database work. The core node worker pool is a simple mechanism for controlling concurrency of background tasks on a per-node basis. It allows for either a single node worker pool to manage concurrency, or a series of pools modelled on the Differentiated Services design pattern.

- There are other more sophisticated candidate methods which have been proposed in this space (e.g. riak_kv_sweeper and riak_core jobs). A decision will be made for the Riak 3.0 release which mechanism should be the standard going forward, but the core node worker pool appears to be the simplest of all the proposals at this stage.

#### Repl API

- Multiple customers of Riak have ended up with some form of bespoke extensions to the Riak replication features, normally to avoid some inefficiency in a replication feature by leveraging knowledge of the application (e.g. keys are time-stamped based, some keys are write-once etc). The repl code itself has expanded complexity to deal with scheduling of jobs, marshalling the use of resource by jobs, managing environmental factors (e.g. NAT, encryption requirements), handling change within the cluster, managing exceptional replication topologies. Going forward, the preferred approach for handling special customer scenarios is to expose core replication features for customers to manage from outside of the database, rather than extending the internal feature scope for each scenario.

- There are two repl features to be exposed in Riak 2.9. The first feature is an API to re-replicate an object: given a key re-replicate this key from the cluster in receipt of the request. The second feature is the availability of an aae_fold API, to give access to cluster-wide AAE trees available as part of the TictacAAE change - as well as the ability to fetch keys and version information from objects within specific segments of the AAE tree

## Additions

### TicTac Active Anti-Entropy

- [Tictac Active Anti-Entropy](https://github.com/martinsumner/kv_index_tictactree).

  - This makes two fundamental changes to the way anti-entropy has historically worked in Riak.  The feature changes the nature of the construction of the Merkle Trees used in Anti-Entropy so that they can be built incrementally.  The feature also changes the nature of the underlying anti-entropy key store so that the store can now be key-ordered, whilst still allowing for acceleration of access to keys by either their Merkle tree location or by the last modified date of the object.

  - Previously anti-entropy had required knowledge of all elements of the tree to build the tree, and for a key store to be kept ordered based on the layout of that tree.  These changes allow for:

    - Lower overhead internal anti-entropy based on *cached trees*.

    - Cluster-wide anti-entropy based on *cached trees* and without the need to pause for cluster-wide full synchronisation to be suspended for long periods while AAE trees and stores are rebuilt. Cached trees are kept updated in parallel to the rebuilding of trees and AAE stores.

    - Cross-cluster Merkle trees to be *independent of the internal layout* of the data in the cluster,

    - Folding anti-entropy.  The rapid and efficient production of anti-entropy Merkle *trees of subsets of the store data*, with those subsets definable at run-time based on *bucket*, *key-range* and *modified date* restrictions.  Allowing for more flexible inter-cluster comparisons (other than comparing whole stores).

  - Database statistics and operator helpers.  The anti-entropy keystore stores keys and additional metadata to support potentially helpful queries, without the need to fold over the vnode object store.  This keystore can then also efficiently support ordered folds for unordered backends (e.g. bitcask).  By folding over ranges of keys and metadata, not slowed by loading in all the values off disk - [administrative database queries](https://github.com/martinsumner/riak_kv/blob/develop-2.9/src/riak_kv_clusteraae_fsm.erl#L165-L208) can now be efficiently supported (e.g. object counts, find keys with siblings, find keys with large object sizes, object size histograms, calculate the average object size of items modified in last 24 hours etc).

  - The Tictac AAE feature can be run in additional to or instead of traditional Riak Active Anti-Entropy mechanisms to ease migration from the existing service.

  - Future work on Tictac AAE is planned to handle issues arising from time-based deletion of objects.  Tictac AAE will not currently work efficiently if a significant portion of objects have automatic TTL-based expiry.

### Leveled backend

- [Leveled backend](https://github.com/martinsumner/leveled).

  - A new database backend to Riak, written entirely in Erlang, and optimised specifically for Riak-style workloads.  Leveled is based on the same [Log Structured Merge (LSM) Tree paper](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~poneil/lsmtree.pdf) as the existing [leveldb](https://github.com/basho/leveldb/wiki) and [hanoidb](https://github.com/krestenkrab/hanoidb) backends, but making specific trade-offs to improve on throughput in some common riak uses cases:

  - LSM-trees supporting larger objects.  Other LSM-tree based these stores have the potential to be bottle-necked by write-amplification (100 fold write amplification has bene seen on large, mature Riak stores using leveldb) when used for storing larger objects (e.g. objects over 4KB).  Leveled splits objects from headers, which was suggested as an option in the original LSM-tree paper, and further explored in the [WiscKey paper](https://www.usenix.org/node/194425) (and implemented in other stores such as Dgraph's [BadgerDB](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger)).  The full object is stored in a sequence-ordered journal separate to the LSM-tree, which contains only Keys and their metadata.  This reduces write amplification for larger values, as the LSM tree merge events are proportionate to the size of the headers not the objects.

  - Replacing GETs with HEADs.  In all existing riak backends, the cost of extracting the header of an object is broadly equivalent to the cost of extracting the whole object.  However, when resolving a GET request, only the headers of the objects are required to determine if the version vectors of the objects match, and if they do match only one vnode is required to return the actual body.  Likewise the PUT path in Riak only requires to see the version object header not the object body before updating an object.

    - By providing a fast-path to accessing the head of the object, Riak with a leveled backend is able to stop the practice of pulling the desired object N times over the network for each GET, using HEAD requests where possible instead.

    - The response time of the HEAD messages also provides early warning of vnode queues and network latency, so that GET requests can be pushed towards fast responding vnodes, better balancing load across the cluster when one or more nodes slower than other nodes in the cluster.

  - Anti-entropy without a secondary store.  The Tictac AAE solution requires an ordered keystore (As does the current Riak AAE solution), but as the Leveled backend already has a dedicated keystore for holding keys and metadata, this can be reused for AAE purposes.  This means that Tictac AAE can be run in `native` mode - where no secondary store is required, queries can be directed back to the actual backend store.

  - A cluster-wide hot-backup facility, which due to reduced write amplification provides for efficient rsync support in a key-ordered backend.

  - Migrating to the leveled backend requires a riak cluster `replace` operation - there is no in-place transition to leveled from an existing backend.

  - It is expected that community interest and support in the [bitcask backend](https://github.com/basho/bitcask) within Riak will continue into Riak 3.0 and beyond, as bitcask still offers throughput advantages with some workloads, where there is no demand for secondary indexes.

  - Some [performance testing results and guidance for choosing a backend have been made available to assist with this decision](https://github.com/martinsumner/riak_testing_notes/blob/master/Release%202.9%20-%20Choosing%20a%20Backend.md).  The optimal decision though is driven by too many variables (e.g. object size, number of keys, distribution of requests to keys, mutability of objects, physical server configuration, feature requirements and levels of application concurrency) to make an optimal decision obvious in most uses cases - realistic use-case specific testing is always recommended.

## Transition Configuration Guidance

This section contains some initial notes to assist with planning and configuration for Transition of pre-2.9 releases to 2.9:

- The leveled backend is not compatible with other backends in terms of the serialised disk format. There is no in-place transition possible from bitcask/eleveldb/hanoidb to leveled. Transitioning requires a node replace operation. It is recommended to:

- First transition to 2.9 with the current backend in-place, minimising the time spent running mis-matched versions in parallel;

- Then as a second phase run a rolling series of node transfers to replace the nodes with the previous backend, with nodes with the leveled backend.

- Testing hash shown that higher transfer-limits can be sued safely when running transfers to leveled nodes, by comparison to transfers to eleveldb nodes.

- If upgrading from a release prior to the introduction of version 1 hashing of AAE, and if you intend to eventually move to TictacAAE - then follow the guidance to not upgrade to version 1. This prevents CPU resource bing invested in the upgrade when it is eventually unnecessary.

- Tictac AAE and Legacy AAE may be run in parallel - set both to active in riak.conf. The cost of running Tictac AAE in parallel can be reduced by adjusting the tictacaae_exchangetick to a higher value. By default this is is set to 120000 ms (2 minutes).

- When Tictac AAE has not been run from the initial loading of the node, then the AAE process will not be fully effective until all nodes have undergone an "AAE rebuild". An increased tictacaae_exchangetick is recommended in this period.
For observability of new features, the stats output from riak-admin status have been extended, but also there is a greater focus on use of logs for standard events, on both exit and entry from the event. Tictac AAE is best observed form indexing the Riak logs (both console.*.log and erlang.*.log), and riak-admin aae-status will no longer offer any information.

- Flushing to disk on every write can be enabled in leveled using leveled.sync_strategy. For Riak 2.9.0, the riak_sync mechanism must be used to enable sync, the sync mechanism is only valid on later versions of OTP.

- Leveled like levedb continuously compacts the keystore (the LSM-tree). However, it must separately compact the value store, and compaction of the value store may be scheduled - using leveled.compaction_runs_perday, leveled.compaction_low_hour, leveled.compaction_high_hour and leveled.max_run_length. The following log should help with tuning:
"IC003", "Scoring of compaction runs complete with highest score=~w with run of run_length=~w",
If the highest score is increasing over time (and positive), then there is a backlog of compaction activity - so increase either the length of the run or the runs per day.

- The size of the journal files can be changed to align with the size of the objects. Set the configuration parameter leveled.journal_size to be approximately the size of around 100 thousand objects.

- Leveled compression can be either native or lz4. lz4 has improved performance in most volume tests, but unless the performance improvement is significant for a use case, sticking with native compression is recommended, as this does not create a dependency on an external library. For objects which are already compressed, and may gain little value from compression, it is recommended switching the compression point to be on_compact rather than on_receipt.

- The code contains a more complete view of startup options for leveled and tictac_aae.

## Change log for this release

- Receive buffer size is now configurable via `advanced.config` with `{webmachine, [{recbuf, 65536}]},`
- As part of the change above, mochiweb has been brought up-to-date with the mainstream mochi repository. This brings through all changes since 2.9.0. Users of the HTTP API should consider these changes when testing the release.
- Log level with the leveled backend can now be set through riak.conf, and the log format has been changed to make the logs easier to index.
- An issue discovered in property-based testing (by Quviq) with object folds in sqn_order has been resolved.
- The process of closing down leveled has been refactored to stop process leaks discovered in property-based testing (by Quviq).
- A workaround to an issue running a leveled unit test in riak make test was leading to a make test failure.
- There are corrections to the Leveled fixes made in RC2 to ensure that the full cache-index situation is handled safely, and a potential deadlock on shutdown between the penciller and an individual sst file is resolved.
- The Riak KV default cache size for leveled is reduced to the leveled default, the maximum size the cache can grow to (via jitter/returned) is reduced, and the number of cache lines are reduced. This means that in a stalled penciller, the next L0 file is constrained to be an order of magnitude smaller than in RC2. This may prevent bad behaviour under heavy handoff load.
- The riak_kv_leveled_backend will now pause the vnode in response to a stalling leveled backend.
- The riak_kv_leveled_backend will support v1 objects only, the riak_kv_vnode will never try to write an object as v0 into leveled.
- It was discovered in handoff scenarios in a leveled backend, Riak consumed much more memory than expected. This was caused by "switched" Level 0 files in the Penciller. These files have a small memory footprint when garbage collected, but a large footprint uncollected - there is a legacy of all the data being on the LoopState in the starting state (but not the reader state). Each file process now does garbage_collect/1 on self at the point of the switch to free this memory immediately.
- fixes some security issues within yokozuna, and completes a full run through of the yokozuna tests. It resolves an issue with HTTP security features crashing Riak which was introduced as part of the RC2 mochiweb uplift to fix the 2i index changes. It also transitions the eleveldb branch used to point back to the `basho` repository, with a fix that allows eleveldb to be deployed on recent OSX versions. An OSX-specific issue with `make test` failing on `eper` and `riak_ensemble` unit tests is also resolved.
