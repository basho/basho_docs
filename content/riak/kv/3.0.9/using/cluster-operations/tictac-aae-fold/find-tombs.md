Returns tuples of bucket name, keyname, and object size of Riak tombstone objects that meet the filter parameters.

See the [TicTac AAE `aae_folds`][tictacaae folds-overview] documentation for configuration, tuning and troubleshootings help.

## The `find_tombs` function

Run this using [`riak attach`][riak attach].

```riakattach
riak_client:aae_fold({
    find_tombs,
    bucket_filter,
    key_range_filter,
    segment_filter
    modified_filter
    }, Client).
```

Please see the list of [available filters](#available-filters) below.

For example, the following snippet will find all tombstones with the filters:

- in the bucket "dogs" of bucket type "animals"
- whose keys are between "A" and "N"
- which were modified in January 2022

```riakattach
riak_client:aae_fold({
    find_tombs,
    {<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>},
    {<<"A">>,<<"N">>},
    all,
    {date,{{2022,1,1},{0,0,0}},{{2022,2,1},{0,0,0}}}
    }, Client).
```

How to get the value for `Client` is detailed in [The Riak Client](../../tictac-aae-fold#the-riak-client).

## The response

The response will be an array of `{bucket_name,key_name,object_size}` tuples that will look something like this:

```erlang
{ok,[{{<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>},<<"Barkie">>,550000},
    {{<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>},<<"Lord Snuffles III">>,820000}]}
```

This indicates that 2 tombstones were found meeting the filter parameters. For each tombstone object found, an additional `{bucket_name,key_name,object_size}` tuple will be added to the array.

Field | Example | Description
:-------|:--------|:--------
bucket_name | `<<"cars">>` or `{<<"animals">>,<<"dogs">>}` | The bucket name as an Erlang binary. In the case of a bucket with a bucket type, a tuple of bucket type and bucket name.
key_name | `<<"Barkie">>` | The key name as an Erlang binary.
object_size | 550000 | The size in bytes of the tombstone object.

## Available filters

These filters are detailed in the [Filters][filters] documentation and can be used to limit the keys considered for reaping or counting.

These filters will reduce the keys to be searched:

- [`bucket_filter`][filter-by bucket]
- [`key_range_filter`][filter-by key-range]
- [`segment_filter`][filter-by segment]

These filters will reduce the number of keys considered for reaping or counting:

- [`modified_filter`][filter-by modified]
