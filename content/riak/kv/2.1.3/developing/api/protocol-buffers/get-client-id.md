{{% note title="Deprecation notice" %}}
The use of client IDs in conflict resolution is now deprecated in Riak. If you
are building or maintaining a Riak client that is intended to be compatible
with Riak 1.4 or later, you can safely ignore client IDs.
{{% /note %}}

Get the client id used for this connection. Client ids are used for
conflict resolution and each unique actor in the system should be
assigned one.  A client id is assigned randomly when the socket is
connected and can be changed using [Set Client ID]({{<baseurl>}}riak/kv/2.1.3/developing/api/protocol-buffers/set-client-id).

## Request

    required bytes client_id = 1; // Client id in use for this connection
