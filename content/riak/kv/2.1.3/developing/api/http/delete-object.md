Deletes an object from the specified bucket / key.

## Request

```
DELETE /buckets/bucket/keys/key
```

Optional query parameters:

* `rw` - quorum for both operations (get and put) involved in deleting an
object (default is set at the bucket level)
* `r` - (read quorum) how many replicas need to agree when retrieving the object
* `pr` - (primary read quorum) works like `r` but requires that the nodes
read from are not fallback nodes
* `w` - (write quorum) how many replicas must confirm receiving writes before returning a successful response
* `dw` - (durable write quorum) how many replicas to commit to durable storage
before returning a successful response
* `pw` - (primary write quorum) how many replicas to commit to primary nodes
before returning a successful response

## Response

Normal response codes:

* `204 No Content`
* `404 Not Found`

Typical error codes:

* `400 Bad Request` - e.g. when rw parameter is invalid (> N)

`404` responses are "normal" in the sense that DELETE operations are idempotent
and not finding the resource has the same effect as deleting it.

## Example

```curl
$ curl -v -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/test/keys/test2
* About to connect() to 127.0.0.1 port 8098 (#0)
