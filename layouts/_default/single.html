<!-- A Note on Template Design
     =========================
  Each block of grouped Go calls that can be wrapped should be wrapped in these
  multi-line HTML comments so the compiled source might be a bit prettier to
  look at; if unwrapped, every unmodified Go call will get its own newline, and
  add an incredible amount of padding to the source.
  All Go calls that can't be wrapped and are given their own line should be
  invoked with the `{ { -` (without the spaces; Hugo would have interpreted that
  as an unclosed action w/o them there.) syntax to remove the newline
  immediately before the action is invoked.
-->

<!-- A Note on Class Naming Conventions
     ==================================

  Our classes are going to be pretty verbose. We're basing names off of the
  Block__Element--Modifier[1] convention, which well let us focus heavily on
  precise description (at the cost of brevity). This should lead to some
  additional self-documentation in the HTML, and will definitely allow for more
  descriptive SCSS. Bootstrap classes will be tacked on after our classes, where
  necessary, and should be denoted with a leading `[bs]` class. It's a vain hope
  of mine to eventually remove the Bootstrap library as a requisite for building
  this site, and knowing beforehand where BS classes are used will help with
  that immensely.

  We've also moved a great deal of formatting information into the HTML, in the
  form of float, clear, and display classes. SCSS should note when floating is
  assumed, but modifications to the `float:` or `display:` properties should be
  made as class additions in the HTML, and not as part of a named class.

<!-- Variable Definitions
     ====================
  We start this template with the "common_variables.html" partial that will
  extract useful variables from content front matter, project descriptions, and
  additional data files, and expose them through the global .Scratch object. For
  each Template / Partial / Range entered, we can then selectively extract
  specific variables from .Scratch that are useful in that context.

  For every new partial, we define a $HugoNode local variable that will be the
  top-level global context (the Hugo Node Object) s.t. we always have a
  consistent method of querying the Hugo Node object that will not change in
  Partials or Ranges.
