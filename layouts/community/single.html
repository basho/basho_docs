<!-- Variable Definitions
     ====================
  See _default/single.html for a general discussion on format and variables.

  This template is specifically for the Community section. Community pages
  require significantly less front matter than project pages, to the point that
  we don't need to include the common_variables.html partial. Save the lack of
  dynamism, these pages will look very similar to more general project pages.
