##Overview

The service manager is the foundation of the Basho Data Platform. It provides a means for building a cluster of nodes that can deploy, run, and manage platform services.

For information on usage check out [data-platform-admin command-line interface](LINK).

##Data Replication and Synchronization

Replicate and synchronize data across and between Riak and Spark, Redis, and Solr service instances to ensure data accuracy with no data loss and high availability.

##Cluster Management & Monitoring
Integrated cluster management automates deployment and configuration of Riak KV, Riak S2, Spark, and Redis. Once deployed in production, auto-detect issues and restart Redis instances or Spark clusters. Cluster management eliminates the need for Zookeeper.

##Internal Data Store

A built-in, distributed data store for ensuring speed, fault-tolerance, and ease-of-operations is used to persist static and dynamic configuration data (port number and IP address) across the Basho Data Platform.

##Logging and Troubleshooting
Event logs provide valuable information that can facilitate the enhanced tuning of clusters and accurately analyze dataflow across the cluster.
