[Transmit](https://www.panic.com/transmit/) is an S3 compatible client with a
graphical user interface for Mac OS X. The following guide describes
configuration of Transmit for use with Riak CS.

<div class="info">Note that S3 support was added in Transmit version 4.4, so
  ensure that you're following along with a version that supports S3 before
  continuing.</div>

## Define a Connection

When Transmit is started, a new connection window appears. Ensure that you've
selected the **S3** tab, then complete the details in the **Connect to S3**
dialog as follows:

* **Server**: Enter the fully qualified domain name of the Riak CS server
  here. Be sure that this matches the value specified for
  `cs_root_host` in the Riak CS `app.config`.

* **Access Key ID**: Enter the Access Key ID (key_id) for the user account
  you will use to connect to Riak CS.

* **Secret**: Enter the Access Key Secret (key_secret) matching the user
  account you entered for the Access Key ID above.

* **Initial Path**: If you're connecting to a Riak CS instance with existing
  buckets to which the user account has access, you can optionally enter a
  specific bucket name to use for this connection here.

Defining a connection looks like this:

<div class="info">Note that Transmit expects a secure connection so ensure
  that your Riak CS proxy server is configured with SSL support. For 
  information on configuring a software solution like HAProxy with SSL, for
  use with Riak CS see 
  [[Load Balancing and Proxy Configuration]].</div>

Finally, test the connection to Riak CS by clicking **Connect**.

## Create a Bucket

After successfully connecting to Riak CS, verify that you can create a bucket.

1. From the **File** menu, select **New Bucket...**.
2. In the bucket creation dialog, enter the name of the new bucket.
3. Click **Create**

The new bucket creation dialog looks like this:

The newly created bucket is listed in the right hand pane of the 
Transmit interface:

## Copy Files

Now that you've created a bucket, you can perform a basic file copy test.

Double click the bucket icon in the right hand pane of the Transmit interface
to access the bucket.

Drag and drop one or more files to the right hand pane to initiate
copying of the files to the bucket.

After copying, the files will appear in the bucket:

You have now successfully configured a Transmit connection to Riak CS and
verified basic file copying capabilities.
