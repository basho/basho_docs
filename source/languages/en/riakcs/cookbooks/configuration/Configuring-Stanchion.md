On the Stanchion node, you set the IP address and port for listening and the Riak IP address and port. On each Riak CS node, you have to set three Stanchion configuration properties.

## Specifying the Stanchion IP Address and Port

If you have a single node, you don't have to change the settings for the address to listen on because Stanchion simply listens to the requests from the local host. If your Riak CS system has multiple nodes, you set the IP address and port that Stanchion listens on for requests from other nodes.

These settings reside in the Stanchion `app.config` file, which is located in the `/etc/stanchion` folder. The settings appear in the `stanchion` config section of the file.

* `stanchion_ip` --- Replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address of the Stanchion node

<div class="note"><div class="title">Note</div>The IP address you enter here must match the IP address specified for the <tt>stanchion_ip</tt> variable in the Riak <tt>app.config</tt> file and the Riak CS <tt>app.config</tt> file. </div>

If you want to use a different port for Stanchion to accept connections on, you must change the following port setting:

* `stanchion_port` --- Replace `8085` with the port number you want to use

The `stanchion_ssl` variable is set to `false` by default. If you want to use SSL, change this variable to `true`.

## Specifying Riak Information

If you have a single node, you don't have to change the setting for the Riak address because Stanchion and Riak are both on the local host. If your Riak CS system has multiple nodes, you must set the IP address and port for Riak in the Stanchion `app.config` file, which is located in the `/etc/riak-cs` folder. The settings appear in the Stanchion config section of the file.

* `riak_ip` --- Replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address of the Riak node.

<div class="note"><div class="title">Note</div>The IP address you enter here must match the IP address specified for the Protocol Buffers interface in the Riak <tt>app.config</tt> file. If a server has more than one network interface card (NIC), you can use the IP address for a specific NIC. If you want Riak CS to listen on all of them, set <tt>riak_ip</tt> to <tt>0.0.0.0</tt>. </div>

If you configured Riak to use a different port for Protocol Buffers, change the following port setting and then restart Riak:

* `riak_pb_port` --- Replace `8087` with the port number set in the Riak `app.config` file.
