[DragonDisk](http://www.dragondisk.com/) is a cross platform S3 compatible
client with a graphical user interface available for Linux, Mac OS X, and
Windows. The following guide describes configuration of DragonDisk for use
with Riak CS.

## Configuration for Linux

DragonDisk is available for multiple Linux distributions. This section
specifically describes configuration for Ubuntu Linux version 12.04
(Precise Pangolin) 32 bit, but the configuration will be similar for other
Linux distributions.

This is the main DragonDisk window as it appears upon starting
the application.

Enter the access key associated with your username into the **Access Key**
field.

Enter the secret key associated with your username into the **Secret Key**

### Connect to Riak CS

Now let's try to connect to Riak CS with the newly defined account
configuration.

In the **Root** drop down menu on the right pane of the DragonDisk interface,
select the **Riak CS** account definition that you created.

If no error occurs and you see the account definition appear in the right
pane, then you're connected to Riak CS and can proceed to creating a bucket.

### Create a bucket

Now that you're connected, create a bucket for testing file access with
Riak CS.

Click the **Create bucket** icon to open the bucket creation dialog.

In the **Create bucket** dialog, give the bucket a name. In this example
we're naming the bucket *dragondisklinux*.

Click **OK** to create the bucket.

The bucket should now appear in the right pane and you can now proceed with
copying some test files into the bucket.
