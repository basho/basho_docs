## Specifying the Admin User

The admin user is authorized to perform actions such as creating buckets or obtaining billing statistics. An admin user account is no different than any other user account.

<div class="note"><div class="title">Note</div>
Before creating an admin user, you must first set <tt>{anonymous_user_creation, true}</tt> in the Riak CS <tt>app.config</tt>. You may disable this again once the admin user has been created.
</div>

To create an account for the admin user, use an HTTP POST with the username you want for the admin account. The following is an example:

```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST http://localhost:8080/riak-cs/user \
  --data '{"email":"foobar@example.com", "name":"admin user"}'
```

The JSON response looks something like:

```json
{
"Email": "foobar@example.com",
"DisplayName": "adminuser"
"KeyId": "324ABC0713CD0B420EFC086821BFAE7ED81442C",
"KeySecret": "5BE84D7EEA1AEEAACF070A1982DDA74DA0AA5DA7",
"Name": "admin user",
"Id":"8d6f05190095117120d4449484f5d87691aa03801cc4914411ab432e6ee0fd6b",
"Buckets": []
}
```

You can optionally send and receive XML, if you set the `Content-Type` to `application/xml`.

Once the admin user exists, you must specify the credentials of the admin user on each node in the Riak CS system. The admin user credential settings reside in the Riak CS `app.config` file, which is located in the `etc/riak-cs` directory. The settings appear in the Riak CS config section of the file. Paste the `key_id` string between the quotes for the `admin_key`. Paste the `key_secret` string into the `admin_secret` variable, as shown here:

```
%% Admin user credentials
 {admin_key, "LXAAII1MVLI93IN2ZMDD"},
 {admin_secret, "5BE84D7EEA1AEEAACF070A1982DDA74DA0AA5DA7"},
```

## Listening on a Public Address

If you have a single node, you don't have to change the settings for the address to listen on, because Riak CS simply listens to the requests from the local host. If your system has multiple nodes, you set the IP address and port that Riak CS listens on for requests from other nodes.

The public address settings reside in the Riak CS `app.config` file, which is located in the` /etc/riak-cs` directory. The settings appear in the Riak CS config section of the file.

__riak_ip__: Replace 127.0.0.1 with the IP address of the Riak node you want Riak CS to connect to.

If you configured Riak to use a different port for protocol buffers, you must change the following port setting:

__riak_pb_port__: Replace 8087 with the port number set in the variable `pb_port` in the Riak `app.config` file.

<div class="note"><div class="title">Note</div>The IP address you enter here must match the IP address specified for the pb_ip variable in the Riak app.config file. If a server has more than one network interface card (NIC), you can use the IP address for a specific NIC. If you want Riak CS to listen on all of them, set riak_ip to "0.0.0.0".</div>

After modifying the port numbers, restart Riak if is already running.

## Specifying the Stanchion Node
If you have a single node, you don't have to change the Stanchion settings, because Stanchion runs on the local host. If your Riak CS system has multiple nodes, you set the IP address and port for the Stanchion node and whether SSL is enabled.

The Stanchion settings reside in the Riak CS app.config file, which is located in the /etc/Riak-CS directory. The settings appear in the Riak CS config section of the file.

__stanchion_ip__: Replace 127.0.0.1 with the IP address of the Stanchion node.

If you configured Stanchion to use a different port, you must change the following port setting:

__stanchion_port__: Replace 8085 with the port number set in the variable stanchion_port in the Stanchion `app.config` file.

The __stanchion_ssl__ variable is set to false by default. If you want to use SSL, change this variable to true.

## Specifying the Node IP Address
You can also set the IP address for the Riak CS node, which is helpful if you must debug code or identify the node from which requests originate. The Riak CS IP address setting resides in the Riak CS `vm.args` configuration file, which is located in the `/etc/riak-cs` directory.

Initially, the line that specifies the Riak CS node IP address is set to the localhost, as follows:

```
## Name of the riak node
-name riak_cs@127.0.0.1
```

Replace 127.0.0.1 with the IP address for the Riak CS node.

## Enabling SSL in Riak CS
In the Riak CS `app.config` file, first uncomment the following lines:

```erlang
%%{ssl, [
%%    {certfile, "./etc/cert.pem"},
%%    {keyfile, "./etc/key.pem"}
%%   ]},
```

Replace the text in quotes with the path and filename for your SSL encryption files.

## Proxy vs. Direct Configuration

### Proxy

The proxy configuration enables an S3 client to communicate with Riak CS as
if it were Amazon S3, using the typical Amazon URLs. First, configure your
client's proxy settings to point to your Riak CS cluster's address. Then,
configure your client with Riak CS credentials.

When Riak CS receives the request to be proxied, it services the request itself
and responds back to the client as if it went to S3.

On the server side, the `cs_root_host` must be set to `s3.amazonaws.com`
because all of the bucket URLs requested by the client will be destined for
`s3.amazonaws.com`

*Note: One issue with proxy configurations is that many GUI clients only allow
for one proxy to be configured for all connections. For customers trying to
connect to S3 and Riak CS, this can prove to be problematic.*

### Direct

Direct configuration requires a client that can be configured for an
"S3-compatible" service.  Some clients with this capability are:
[Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/), [s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd),
and [DragonDisk](http://www.dragondisk.com/).

In this configuration, the client connects to Riak CS as the endpoint. There is
no masquerading as Amazon S3.

In this case, the `cs_root_host` must be set to the FQDN of your Riak CS
endpoint, as all of the bucket URLs will be destined for FQDN endpoint.

You will also need wildcard DNS entries for any child of the endpoint to
resolve to the endpoint itself.  For example:

```
data.riakcs.net
*.data.riakcs.net
```

## Other Riak CS Settings

{{#1.4.0+}}
There are a two configuration options designed to provide improved
performance for Riak CS when using Riak 1.4.0 or later. These options
take advantage of additions to Riak that are not present prior to
version 1.4.0.

__fold_objects_for_list_keys__: Setting this option to `true` enables
Riak CS to use a more efficient method of retrieving Riak CS bucket
contents from Riak. Using this option provides improved performance
and stability, especially for buckets that contain on the order of
millions of objects or more. This option should not be enabled unless
Riak 1.4.0 or greater is being used. The default value for this option
is `false`.

__n_val_1_get_requests__: This option causes Riak CS to use a special
request option when retrieving the blocks of an object. This option
instructs Riak to only send a request for the object block to a single
eligible virtual node (vnode) instead of all eligible vnodes. This
differs from the standard `r` request option that Riak provides in
that `r` affects how many vnode responses to wait for before returning
and has no effect on how many vnodes are actually contacted. Enabling
this option has the effect of greatly reducing the intra-cluster
bandwidth used by Riak when retrieving objects with Riak CS. This
option is harmless when used with a version of Riak that is less than
1.4.0, but the option to disable it is provided as a safety
measure. The default value for this option is `true`.
{{/1.4.0+}}

The `app.config` file includes other settings, such as whether to create log files and where to store them. These settings have default values that work in most cases.
