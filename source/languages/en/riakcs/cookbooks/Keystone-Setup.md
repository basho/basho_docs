Keystone is a Python application that requires a number of dependencies
to be installed. This document covers how to use Python,
[pip](https://github.com/basho/stanchion), and
[virtualenv](https://github.com/basho/stanchion) to set up an isolated
test environment for running and testing Keystone.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure Python is installed.
1. Install pip, the Python package tool. Installation instructions can
   be found [here](http://guide.python-distribute.org/installation.html#installing-pip).
   pip can also be installed via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) for Mac OS
   X users.

1. Install `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`:

    ```bash
    pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper`
    ```

1. Set up `virtualenvwrapper`. Add the following lines to your
   `.bash_profile` to get the `virtualenvwrapper` scripts in the path.

    ```bash
    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
    ```

1. Clone the Keystone repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/openstack/keystone.git
    ```

1. Navigate to the Keystone repo and checkout the proper tag:

    ```bash
    git checkout grizzly-2
    ```

## Create a Virtual Environment for Keystone

Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```bash
mkvirtualenv keystone-test
```

The `keystone-test` virtual environment is now created, activated, and
ready to use.

## Install the Keystone dependencies

The dependencies for running Keystone can be found in
`tools/pip-requires`.  At the time of this writing, `grizzly-2` is the
latest tag of Keystone and the dependencies are based on versions that
work with that tag. Use `pip` to install the dependencies as follows:

```bash
pip install -r tools/pip-requires
```

## Configure Keystone

The next step is to select the appropriate options in the
`keystone.conf` configuration file. A sample configuration that is
useful for local testing with Riak CS can be found [[here|Keystone
Configuration Sample]]. This configuration file sets up logging to
`./log/keystone/keystone.log` and uses the templated catalog backend to
set up the Riak CS object store service. This catalog backend uses a
local file to populate the service catalog.

The default file in the previously referenced sample `keystone.conf`
file uses `etc/default_catalog.templates`, but this can be changed. Set
the contents of `etc/default_catalog.templates` to be the following:

```config
# config for TemplatedCatalog, using camelCase
catalog.RegionOne.identity.publicURL = http://localhost:$(public_port)s/v2.0
catalog.RegionOne.identity.adminURL = http://localhost:$(admin_port)s/v2.0
catalog.RegionOne.identity.internalURL = http://localhost:$(public_port)s/v2.0
catalog.RegionOne.identity.name = Identity Service

catalog.RegionOne.object-store.publicURL = http://localhost:8080/v1/AUTH_$(tenant_id)s
catalog.RegionOne.object-store.adminURL = http://localhost:8080/
catalog.RegionOne.object-store.internalURL = http://localhost:8080/v1/AUTH_$(tenant_id)s
catalog.RegionOne.object-store.name = 'Object Store Service'
```

## Optional configuration

For testing, it can be easier to configure keystone to use UUID as the
token format. To do this, edit `keystone.conf` and set the following:

```config
token_format = UUID
```

## Prepare the database

```bash
./bin/keystone-manage db_sync
```

## Run Keystone

```bash
./bin/keystone-all --config-file \
  /<absolute-path-to-keystone-repo>/keystone/etc/keystone.conf -d --debug
```

The following script can be used to set a number of useful environment
variables to make using the Keystone client less cumbersome.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

export OS_SERVICE_TOKEN=ADMIN
export OS_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:35357/v2.0
export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=2.0
export OS_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:5000/v2.0
export OS_USERNAME=test
export OS_PASSWORD=test
export OS_TENANT_NAME=test
```
