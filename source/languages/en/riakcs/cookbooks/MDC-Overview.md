## Riak CS Enterprise

Riak CS Enterprise extends Riak CS with multi-datacenter replication,
monitoring, and 24×7 support. Customers use multi-datacenter
replication to serve global traffic, create availability zones,
maintain active backups, or meet disaster recovery and regulatory
requirements. Multi-datacenter replication can be used in two or more
sites. Data can be replicated across data centers using real-time or
full sync.

### Multi-Datacenter Replication

Multi-datacenter replication in Riak CS provides two modes of object
replication: full sync and real-time sync. Data is streamed over a TCP
connection, and multi-datacenter replication in Riak CS has support
for SSL so data can be securely replicated between sites.

In Riak CS, large objects are broken into blocks and streamed to the
underlying Riak cluster on write, where they are replicated for high
availability (3 replicas by default). A manifest for each object is
maintained so that blocks can be retrieved from the cluster and the
full object presented to clients. For multi-site replication in Riak
CS, global information for users, bucket information and manifests are
streamed in real-time from a primary implementation to a secondary
site so global state is maintained across locations. Objects can then
be replicated in either full or real-time sync mode.

#### Full Sync Mode

In full sync, objects are replicated from a primary Riak CS
implementation to a secondary site on a configurable interval - the
default is 6 hours. In full-sync replication, each cluster computes a
hash for each key’s block value. Key/block pairs are compared, and the
primary site streams any missing blocks or updates needed to the
secondary site.

#### Real-Time Sync Mode

Real-time sync is triggered when an update is sent from a client to a
primary Riak CS implementation. Once replicated in the first location,
the updates are streamed in real-time to the secondary site. But what
happens if a client requests an object from the secondary cluster and
not all of its blocks have been replicated to that cluster? With Riak
multi-site replication, the secondary cluster will request any missing
blocks from the primary cluster so that the client can be served.
