Multipart upload allows users of Riak CS to upload large objects as a
set of smaller parts. This feature allows users to pause and resume
the upload of a large object or begin an upload without prior knowledge
of the total size of the whole object. It is also allows for more efficient
uploads since parts may be uploaded in parallel.

There are three phases to a multipart upload: initiation, parts
upload, and completion. Each phase is described in more detail
below. Multipart uploads with Riak CS are designed to behave
in the same manner as multipart uploads to Amazon S3 and the
API is the same.

## Multipart Upload Phases

#### Multipart Upload Initiation

Initiation is done by sending a properly formatted multipart upload
initiation request to Riak CS. If the upload initiation is successful
the response from Riak CS includes an upload ID.

This ID is a unique identifier for a particular multipart upload
and *must* be included with all subsequent requests to Riak CS
pertaining to this upload. This includes any of the upload
operations described in the remainder of this document except for
listing all active multipart uploads.

Metadata may be attached to an object uploaded using multipart upload
just like any other object stored in Riak CS. To do so the metadata
should be included with the multipart upload initiation request.

#### Parts Upload

A part upload must include both the upload ID received in response
to an initiation request and a part number. Part numbers should be
integers between 1 and 10,000. These numbers identify a part
within the context of the multipart upload and also specify
positioning within the final object. Uploading a part with a part
number that has previously been uploaded results in the previous
part associated with that part number being overwritten.

For each part that is uploaded, Riak CS returns an `ETag` header as
part of the response. Each `ETag` value and the part number it
corresponds to should be reserved for use in the multipart upload
completion request.

The size of each part may be in the range of 5MB to 5GB.

#### Multipart Upload Completion

Once a complete multipart upload request is received, Riak CS
assembles the object from the uploaded parts. Subsequently, the object
is presented as a single entity to the user with no difference from
any other object stored in Riak CS. The uploaded parts are no longer
individually accessible.

A complete multipart upload request *must* include the upload ID and a
list of all part numbers and their corresponding `ETag` values. Riak
CS returns another `ETag` that identifies the completed object. It
should be noted that this `ETag` value is not necessarily an MD5 hash
of the object data and this fact may cause warnings to be issued by
some client libraries or tools.

## Terminating an upload

#### Abort Multipart Upload

A multipart upload request may be aborted prior to sending an
upload completion request. The storage for all parts that have
been fully uploaded will be released.

Part uploads that are in-progress *may not* have their storage
released, so to ensure all storage is reclaimed, the abort request
should only be sent after all parts already in progress have
uploaded.

Once a multipart upload is aborted, the upload ID is no longer
valid.

## Listing uploads

#### Active Multipart Uploads

Riak CS can list all of the active multipart uploads for each user
account. The number of multipart uploads included in the response is
capped at 1000. If there are more than 1000 active multipart uploads
for a particular user account, they can be listed by using multiple
requests.

#### Completed Parts From An Active Upload

Riak CS can list the parts that have been successfully uploaded
for a specific multipart upload. If a multipart upload is
comprised of more than 1000 parts then the parts must be retrieved
using multiple parts requests.

The results of this request are not intended to be used when sending a
complete multipart upload request. The proper procedure is to record
the part numbers and the associated `ETag` values returned with part
upload responses and use that information when completing a multipart
upload.
