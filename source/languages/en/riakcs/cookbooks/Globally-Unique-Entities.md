There are two entities that must be globally unique within a Riak CS system.

The first entity is *user identifiers*. Riak CS mandates that each
user create an account using an email address as an identifier and
takes steps to ensure that an email address has not already been used
before accepting a user creation request.

The other entity is *bucket names*. Bucket names must be unique within
a Riak CS system and attempts to create a bucket with a name that is
already in use are rejected.

The uniqueness of these entities is enforced by serializing creation
or modification requests involving them. The request serialization
application for the Riak CS system is
[*Stanchion*](https://github.com/basho/stanchion). More specific
details on its implementation can be found in its
[README](https://github.com/basho/stanchion/blob/master/README.org)
file. Uniqueness is further enforced by mandating that all of the
primary vnodes of the underlying Riak cluster that are responsible for
the user or bucket being created be available at creation time. One
result of this enforcement is that user creation requests and bucket
creation or modification (*i.e.* deletion) requests are not highly
available like other Riak CS system operations. If the Stanchion
application is unavailable or cannot be reached for any reason then
the aforementioned user and bucket operations will not be allowed to
complete. Additionally, instability in the Riak cluster may lead to
user and bucket requests being disallowed.  This would be indicated by
error messages similar to this in the Stanchion console or error log
files:

```
2013-01-03 05:24:24.028 [warning] <0.110.0>@stanchion_utils:bucket_available:501 Error occurred trying to check if the bucket <<"mybucket">> exists. Reason: <<"{pr_val_unsatisfied,3,2}">>
```

As such, these operations should *only* be used as preparation for
a workflow and **not** actually included as part of a highly available
workflow.
