To launch Riak CS in the background, enter:

```bash
sudo riak-cs start
```

To run Riak CS with an interactive Erlang console:

```bash
sudo riak-cs console
```

When Riak CS is running, the Riak CS process appears in the process list. To check for the Riak CS process, enter:

```bash
ps -ef|grep riak-cs
```

To stop Riak CS, enter:

```bash
sudo riak-cs stop
```

You can use the command:

```bash
sudo riak-cs attach
```

to attach and obtain an interactive console to a running instance of Riak CS.

You can check the liveness of your Riak CS installation with the `riak-cs ping` command, which should return `pong` if Riak CS is up and able to successfully communicate with Riak.

```bash
riak-cs ping
```

<div class="note"><div class="title">Note</div>The <tt>riak-cs ping</tt> command will fail if the Riak CS node is not able to communicate with the supporting Riak node. Ensure all components of the Riak CS system are running before checking liveness with <tt>riak-cs ping</tt>.</div>
