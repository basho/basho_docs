A fully functional Riak CS system is comprised of Riak CS, Stanchion, and Riak. The supported operating systems include Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Solaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, and OS X. Riak CS is not supported on Microsoft Windows. You can install Riak CS on a single node or using an automated deployment tool.


## Installing Riak CS on a Node
Riak CS and Stanchion packages are available on the [[Download Riak CS]] page.  Similarly, Riak packages are available on the [Download Riak](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/downloads/) page

After downloading Riak CS, Stanchion, and Riak, install them using your operating system's package management commands.

<div class="note"><div class="title">Note</div><strong>Riak CS is not designed to function directly on TCP port 80, and it should not be operated in a manner which exposes it directly to the public internet</strong>. Instead, consider a load balancing solution, such as dedicated device, <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu">HAProxy</a> or <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a> between Riak CS and the outside world.</div>

### Installing Riak CS on Ubuntu
The following command installs Riak CS on a machine running either Debian or Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo dpkg -i <riak-cs-package.deb>
```

Replace `<riak-cs-package.deb>` with the actual file name for the package you are installing.

### Installing Riak CS on CentOS
The following command installs Riak CS on a machine running CentOS.

```bash
rpm -Uvh <riak-cs-package.rpm>
```

Replace `<riak-cs-package.rpm>` with the actual file name for the package you are installing.

## Installing Stanchion
In a Riak CS system, Stanchion is installed on only one of the nodes in the system. Running Stanchion on more than one node can lead to problems if Riak CS nodes are configured to communicate using multiple Stanchion nodes. In this situation, the uniqueness of bucket names and user email addresses might not be enforced, which, in turn, could lead to unexpected behavior. Use the commands in the section for your operating system to install a pre-built Stanchion package on the node you choose for Stanchion.

### Installing Stanchion on Ubuntu
The following command installs Stanchion on a machine running Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo dpkg -i <riak-cs-package.deb>
```
Replace `<riak-cs-package.deb>` with the actual file name for the package you are installing.

### Installing Stanchion on CentOS

The following command installs Stanchion on a machine running either Red Hat linux or CentOS.

```bash
sudo rpm -Uvh <stanchion-package.rpm>
```

Replace `<stanchion-package.rpm>` with the actual file name for the package you are installing.


<div class="note"><div class="title">Note</div>CentOS enables Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) by default. If you encounter errors during installation, try disabling SELinux.</div>
