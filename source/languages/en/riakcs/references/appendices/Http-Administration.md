Riak CS exposes these administrative capabilities over HTTP above and
beyond Riak itself:

| Task                   | CS URI           | Further reading                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| User management        | `/riak-cs/user`  | [[Account Management]]          |
| User access statistics | `/riak-cs/usage` | [[Querying Access Statistics]]  |
| Storage statistics     | `/riak-cs/usage` | [[Querying Storage Statistics]] |
| Global statistics      | `/riak-cs/stats` | [[Monitoring and Metrics]]      |

By default, these are accessible over the same IP/port as the rest of
the CS API, but they can be configured to run elsewhere, with or
without authentication.

## Output format

For these requests, results are available as either JSON or XML.
Request the appropriate one by using the HTTP `Accept` header (with
either `application/json` or `application/xml`, respectively).

## URLs

Each of these requests is performed over the CS HTTP port (`8080` by
default) or administrative port if configured via `admin_port`.  The
`admin_ip` configuration setting can be used to further isolate the
administrative commands.

Only the admin user can view other users' details unless
`admin_auth_enabled` is configured to `false`.

## Retrieving statistics via S3 objects

As an alternative to raw HTTP requests, the administrative requests
can be issued via the S3 API. See the github documents linked below
for more details.
