The `PUT Bucket` operation creates a new bucket. The user who sends the request to create the bucket becomes the bucket owner. Anonymous requests can't create buckets.

*Note:* To create a bucket, you must have a valid Key ID, which is used to authenticate requests.

## Bucket Naming

A best practice is to use DNS-compliant bucket names. DNS-compliant bucket names ensure that virtual hosted-style requests can locate buckets.

A bucket name must obey the following rules, which produces a DNS-compliant bucket name:

* Must be from 3 to 63 characters.
* Must be one or more labels, each separated by a period (.). Each label:
* Must start with a lowercase letter or a number. Must end with a lowercase letter or a number. Can contain lowercase letters, numbers and dashes.
* Must not be formatted as an IP address (e.g., 192.168.9.2).

## Access Permissions

PUT Bucket offers the option to specify the permissions you want to grant to specific accounts or groups for the bucket. You can grant permissions to accounts or groups with request headers, using one of the following two methods:

* Specify a predefined ACL using the x-amz-acl request header. More information about predefined ACLs is available [[here|http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ACLOverview.html#CannedACL]].
* Specify access permissions explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-write, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, x-amz-grant-full-control headers, which map to the set of ACL permissions supported by Amazon S3.

*Note*: You can use either a predefined ACL or specify access permissions explicitly, not both.
