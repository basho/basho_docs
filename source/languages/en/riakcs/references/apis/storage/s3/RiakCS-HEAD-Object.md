The `HEAD Object` operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object.

*Note:* You must have READ access to the object to use this operation.

A HEAD request has the same options as a GET operation on an object, and the HEAD response is identical to the GET response, except that there is no response body.

## Requests

### Request Syntax

```
HEAD /ObjectName HTTP/1.1
Host: bucketname.data.basho.com
