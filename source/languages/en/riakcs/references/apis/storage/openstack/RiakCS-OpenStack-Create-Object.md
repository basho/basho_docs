Writes or overwrites an object's content and metadata.

Riak CS is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object at the same time, the system will overwrite all but the last object written. If necessary, you can build versioning or object locking into your application.

To prevent the storage of data corrupted during transmission over a network, the Content-MD5 header instructs Riak CS to compare the object to the MD5 value provided. If the values don't match, the operation returns an error. In addition, if the PUT Object operation calculates the MD5, you can compare the ETag that is returned to the calculated MD5 value.

*Note*: You can configure an application to use the `100-continue` HTTP status code, which sends the Request Headers prior to sending the request body. Doing so prevents sending the message body when the message is rejected based on the headers, for example, due to authentication failure or redirect).
