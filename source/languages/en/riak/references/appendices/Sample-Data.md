When learning how to use a database, reading tutorials and blogs and watching videos will only take a user so far. At some point, you actually have to use the database! And, essential to using any database is having sample data to put into it.

This page is intended to be a repository of sample data for that exact purpose. We will be expanding it as often as possible with different types of data that are suitable for different types of application testing.

And, if you have sample data that you can spare or pointers to some data of which you are particularly fond, shoot an email to _docs@basho.com_ and we'll add it to the page and expand the list.

### Google Historical Stock Data

This *[.csv](https://github.com/basho/basho_docs/raw/master/source/data/goog.csv)* of GOOG historical stock data was originally used for [[MapReduce examples in The Riak Fast Track|Loading Data and Running MapReduce Queries]].

### Compressed Twitter Data

Need some Twitter data to play with? Linked *[[at the bottom of this great blog post by the Rowfeeder team|http://blog.rowfeeder.com/2010/06/lakers-vs-celtics-social-media-breakdown-nba/]]* are a few compressed .csv files (coming in around 58MB) that might be appropriate for your testing.

### Enron Email Dataset

What better to test with than the emails of corrupt corporate officials? *[[Hosted here courtesy of the Carnegie Mellon CS Department|http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/]]*, the complete Enron Email Corpus is about 0.5M messages from around 150 different users, organized into folders for your testing convenience.

### WindyCityDB NoSQL Lab Sample Data

The organizers at WindyCityDB aggregated some sample data to use with their lab session on NoSQL DBs. *[[Linked here|http://github.com/chicagoruby/Windy-City-DB-Dataset]]* are some JSON and XML files that might be just what you need to take Riak for spin.
