This is intended to be a brief, objective and technical comparison of Riak and CouchDB.  The CouchDB version described is 1.2.x. The Riak version described is Riak 1.1.x. If you feel this comparison is unfaithful at all for whatever reason, please [fix it](https://github.com/basho/basho_docs/issues/new) or send an email to **docs@basho.com**.

## At A Very High Level

* Riak and CouchDB are both Apache 2.0 licensed
* Riak is written primarily in Erlang with some bits in C; CouchDB is written in Erlang

## Feature/Capability Comparison

The table below gives a high level comparison of Riak and CouchDB features/capabilities.  To keep this page relevant in the face of rapid development on both sides, low level details are found in links to Riak and CouchDB online documentation.

Finally, there exist some community plugins to expand CouchDB's queryability, such as the CouchDB-Lucene full-text search plugin.

        <td>Data Versioning and Consistency</td>
        <td> Riak uses a data structure called a vector clock to reason about causality and staleness of stored values. Vector clocks enable clients to always write to the database in exchange for consistency conflicts being resolved at read time by either application or client code. Vector clocks can be configured to store copies of a given datum based on size and age of said datum.   There is also an option to disable vector clocks and fall back to simple time-stamp based "last-write-wins".

        <td>CouchDB replicates newer document versions between nodes, making it an eventually consistent system. CouchDB uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to avoid locking the database file during writes. Conflicts are left to the application to resolve at write time. Older document versions (called revisions) may be lost when the append-only database file is compacted.

		 </td>
		
        <td>Because of CouchDB's append-only value mutation, individual instances will not lock. When distributed, CouchDB won't allow updating similarly keyed document without a preceding version number, and conflicts must be manually resolved before concluding a write.

        <td>Replication</td>
        <td>Riak's replication system is heavily influenced by the Dynamo Paper and Dr. Eric Brewer's CAP Theorem. Riak uses consistent hashing to replicate and distribute N copies of each value around a Riak cluster composed of any number of physical machines. Under the hood, Riak uses virtual nodes to handle the distribution and dynamic rebalancing of data, thus decoupling the data distribution from physical assets.
			<ul>
			  <li>[[Replication]]</li>
			  <li>[[Clustering|Concepts#Clustering]]</li>
			</ul>
			
			The Riak APIs expose tunable consistency and availability parameters that let you select which level configuration is best for your use case. Replication is configurable at the bucket level when first storing data in Riak. Subsequent reads and writes to that data can have request-level parameters.

        <td>Scaling Out and In</td>
        <td>Riak allows you to elastically grow and shrink your cluster while evenly balancing the load on each machine. No node in Riak is special or has any particular role. In other words, all nodes are masterless. When you add a physical machine to Riak, the cluster is made aware of its membership via gossiping of ring state. Once it's a member of the ring, it's assigned an equal percentage of the partitions and subsequently takes ownership of the data belonging to those partitions. The process for removing a machine is the inverse of this. Riak also ships with a comprehensive suite of command line tools to help make node operations simple and straightforward.
