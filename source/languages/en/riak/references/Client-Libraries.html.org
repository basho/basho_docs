Basho officially supports a number of open-source client libraries for various programming languages and environments.

All official clients use the integrated issue tracker on Github for bug reporting.

In addition to the official clients, Basho provides some unofficial
client libraries, listed below. There are also many client libraries
and related projects [[references/Community-Developed-Libraries-and-Projects/][provided by the community]].

* Feature Matrix
   Below is a series of tables that compares the functionality of our
   official client libraries with the features exposed by Riak's API,
   and also compares features that are desirable in well-developed
   clients. We have developed this matrix in an effort to ensure
   feature-parity across the different clients.

   Legend:
   - =✓= - has feature
   - =✗= - lacks feature
   - =text= - partially supports feature
   - (blank) - unknown

    /Note: The PHP client does not support Protocol Buffers and so is
    excluded from this matrix./
