# Command Line Tools - `riak`

This is the primary script for controlling the Riak node process.


```bash
Usage: riak { start | stop | restart | reboot | ping | console | attach | chkconfig }
```


## start

Starts the Riak node in the background. If the node is already started, you will
get the message "Node is already running!" If the node is not already running,
no output will be given.


```bash
riak start
```


## stop

Stops the running Riak node. Prints "ok" when successful, "Node 'riak@127.0.0.1'
not responding to pings." when the node is already stopped or not responding.


```bash
riak stop
```


## restart

Stops and then starts the running Riak node without exiting the Erlang VM.
Prints "ok" when successful, "Node 'riak@127.0.0.1' not responding to pings."
when the node is already stopped or not responding.



```bash
riak restart
```


## reboot

Stops and then starts the running Riak node, exiting the Erlang VM. Prints "ok"
when successful, "Node 'riak@127.0.0.1' not responding to pings." when the node
is already stopped or not responding.


```bash
riak reboot
```


## ping

Checks that the Riak node is running. Prints "pong" when successful, "Node
'riak@127.0.0.1' not responding to pings." when the node is stopped or not
responding.


```bash
riak ping
```


## console

Starts the Riak node in the foreground, giving access to the Erlang shell and
runtime messages. Prints "Node is already running - use 'riak attach' instead"
when the node is running in the background.


```bash
riak console
```


## attach

Attaches to the console of a Riak node running in the background, giving access
to the Erlang shell and runtime messages. Prints "Node is not running!" when the
node cannot be reached.



```bash
riak attach
```


## chkconfig

Confirms whether the app.config is valid.


```bash
riak chkconfig
