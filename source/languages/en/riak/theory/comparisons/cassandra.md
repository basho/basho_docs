This is intended to be a brief, objective, and technical comparison of
Riak and Cassandra. The Cassandra version described is 1.2.x. The Riak
version described is Riak 2.x. If you feel this comparison is unfaithful
for whatever reason, please [submit an
issue](https://github.com/basho/basho_docs/issues/new) or send an email
to **docs@basho.com**.

## At A Very High Level

* Both Riak and Cassandra are Apache 2.0-licensed databases based on
  Amazonâ€™s Dynamo paper
* Riak is a faithful implementation of Dynamo, with the addition of
  functionality like links, MapReduce, indexes, full-text Search.
  Cassandra departs from the Dynamo paper slightly by omitting vector
  clocks and moving from partition-based consistent hashing to key
  ranges, while adding functionality like order-preserving partitioners
  and range queries.
* Riak is written primarily in Erlang with some bits in C.
  Cassandra is written in Java.

## Feature/Capability Comparison

The table below provides a high-level comparison of Riak and Cassandra
features/capabilities. To keep this page relevant in the face of rapid
development on both sides, low-level details are found in links to Riak
and Cassandra online documentation.

    <tr>
        <td><strong>Data Versioning and Consistency</strong></td>
        <td>Riak uses a data structure called a [[vector clock|Vector Clocks]] to reason about causality and staleness of stored values. Vector clocks enable clients to always write to the database in exchange for consistency conflicts being resolved either at read time by application or client code or by Riak's [[active anti-entropy]] subsystem. Vector clocks can be configured to store copies of a given object based on the size and age of that object. There is also an option to disable vector clocks and fall back to simple timestamp-based resolution, known as [[last write wins|Conflict Resolution#Client-and-Server-side-Conflict-Resolution]].
            <ul>

            In addition, as of version 2.0 you can use Riak in a [[strongly consistent|Strong Consistency]] fashion.
        </td>

        <td><strong>Concurrency</strong></td>
        <td>In Riak, any node in the cluster can coordinate a read/write operation for any other node. Riak stresses availability for writes and reads, and puts the burden of resolution on the client at read time.
        </td>
        <td>All nodes in Cassandra are peers. A client read or write request can go to any node in the cluster. When a client connects to a node and issues a read or write request, that node serves as the coordinator for that particular client operation.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Replication</strong></td>
        <td>Riak's replication system is heavily influenced by the Dynamo Paper and Dr. Eric Brewer's CAP Theorem. Riak uses consistent hashing to replicate and distribute N copies of each value around a Riak cluster composed of any number of physical machines. Under the hood, Riak uses virtual nodes to handle the distribution and dynamic rebalancing of data, thus decoupling the data distribution from physical assets.
            <ul>
                <li>[[Replication]]</li>
                <li>[[Clustering|Clusters]]</li>
            </ul>
            The Riak APIs expose tunable consistency and availability parameters that let you select which level of configuration is best for your use case. Replication is configurable at the bucket level when first storing data in Riak. Subsequent reads and writes to that data can have request-level parameters.
            <ul>
                <li>[[Reading, Writing, and Updating Data|Concepts#Reading, Writing, and Updating Data]]</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td>Replication in Cassandra starts when a user chooses a partitioner. Partitioners include Random Partitioner (which also relies on consistent hashing for data storage) and various Ordered Partitioner options. Under the hood, physical nodes are assigned tokens which determine a nodes's position on the ring and the range of data for which it's responsible.
            <ul>
                <li>[[Replication|http://www.datastax.com/docs/1.0/cluster_architecture/replication]]</li>
            </ul>
            Like in Riak, Cassandra lets developers configure the consistency and availability requirements at the request level via various APIs.

    <tr>
        <td><strong>Scaling Out and In</strong></td>
        <td>Riak allows you to [[elastically grow and shrink|Adding and Removing Nodes]] your cluster while evenly balancing the load on each machine. No node in Riak is special or has any particular role. In other words, all nodes are masterless. When you add a physical machine to Riak, the cluster is made aware of its membership via gossiping of [[ring state|Clusters#the-ring]]. Once it's a member of the ring, it's assigned an equal percentage of the partitions and subsequently takes ownership of the data belonging to those partitions. The process for removing a machine is the inverse of this. Riak also ships with a comprehensive suite of [[command line tools|riak-admin Command Line]] to help make node operations simple and straightforward.
        </td>
        <td>Cassandra allows you to add new nodes dynamically with the exception of manually calculating a node's token (though users can elect to let Cassandra calculate this). It's recommended that you double the size of your cluster to add capacity. If this isn't feasible, you can elect to either add a number of nodes (which requires token recalculation for all existing nodes), or to add one node at a time, which means leaving the initial token blank and "will probably not result in a perfectly balanced ring but it will alleviate hot spots".
