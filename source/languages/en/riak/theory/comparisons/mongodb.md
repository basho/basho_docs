This is intended to be a brief, objective, and technical comparison of
Riak and MongoDB. The MongoDB version described is 2.2.x. The Riak
version described is Riak 1.2.x. If you feel this comparison is
unfaithful for whatever reason, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/basho/basho_docs/issues/new)
or send an email to **docs@basho.com**.

## At A Very High Level

* Riak is [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) licensed; MongoDB is distributed under the [AGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)
* Riak is written primarily in Erlang with some bits in C; MongoDB is written in C++

## Feature/Capability Comparison

The table below provides a high-level comparison of Riak and MongoDB features and capabilities. To keep this page relevant in the face of rapid development on both sides, low-level details can be found in links to specific pages in the online documentation for both systems.

        <!-- Riak -->
        <td>
            Riak stores key/value pairs under [[keys|Keys and Objects]] in [[buckets]]. [[Using bucket types]] you can set bucket-level configurations for things like [[replication properties]]. In addition to basic [[key/value lookup|Key/Value Modeling]], Riak has a variety of features for discovering objects, including [[Riak Search|Using Search]] and [[secondary indexes|Using Secondary Indexes]].

        <!-- MongoDB -->
        <td>
            MongoDB's data format is BSON (a binary equivalent to JSON) stored as documents (self-contained records with no intrinsic relationships). Documents in MongoDB may store any of the defined BSON types and are grouped in collections.

        <!-- Riak -->
        <td>
            Riak has a modular, extensible local storage system that lets you plug in a backend store of your choice to suit your use case. The default backend is [[Bitcask]].
            
            <ul>

            You can also write your own storage backend for Riak using our [[backend API|Backend API]].
        </td>
        
        <!-- MongoDB -->
        <td>
            MongoDB's default storage system is the Memory-Mapped Storage Engine. It uses memory-mapped files for all disk I/O. It is the responsibility of the OS to manage flushing data to disk and paging data in and out.

        <td><strong>Data Access and APIs</strong></td>
        
        <!-- Riak -->
        <td>
            Riak offers two primary interfaces (in addition to raw Erlang access):
			
            <ul>
                <li>[[Protocol Buffers|PBC API]] (strongly recommended)</li>
                <li>[[HTTP|HTTP API]]</li>
			</ul>
			
            Riak [[client libraries]] are wrappers around these APIs, and client support exists for dozens of languages. Basho currently has officially supported clients for [[Java|https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client]], [[Ruby|https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client]], [[Python|https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client]], and [[Erlang|https://github.com/basho/riak-erlang-client]].

        <td><strong>Query Types and Queryability</strong></td>

        <!-- Riak -->
        <td>

            There are currently five ways to query data in Riak:
            
            <ul>
                <li>Via [[primary key operations|The Basics]] (GET, PUT, DELETE, UPDATE)</li>
                <li>[[Using MapReduce]]</li>
                <li>[[Using secondary indexes]]</li>

            </ul>
        </td>
        
        <!-- MongoDB -->
        <td>
            MongoDB has a query interface that has some similarities to relational databases, including secondary indexes that can be derived from the stored documents. MongoDB also has facilities for performing MapReduce queries and ad-hoc queries on documents. Hadoop support is available as well.

    <tr>
        <td><strong>Data Versioning and Consistency</strong></td>

        <!-- Riak -->
        <td>
            Riak uses a data structure called a [[vector clock|Vector Clocks]] to reason about causality and staleness of stored values. Vector clocks enable clients to always write to the database in exchange for consistency conflicts being resolved either at read time by application or client code or by Riak's [[active anti-entropy]] subsystem. Vector clocks can be configured to store copies of a given object based on the size and age of that object. There is also an option to disable vector clocks and fall back to simple timestamp-based resolution, known as [[last write wins|Conflict Resolution#Client-and-Server-side-Conflict-Resolution]].

            </ul>
        
            In addition, as of version 2.0 you can use Riak in a [[strongly consistent|Strong Consistency]] fashion.
        </td>

        <!-- MongoDB -->
        <td>
            MongoDB exhibits strong consistency. Eventually consistent reads can be accomplished via secondaries. A MongoDB cluster (with auto-sharding and replication) has a master server at any given point in time for each shard.
            
            <ul>

        </td>
    </tr>
        <td><strong>Concurrency</strong></td>

        <!-- Riak -->
        <td>
            In Riak, any node in the cluster can coordinate a read/write operation for any other node. Riak stresses availability for writes and reads, and puts the burden of resolution on the client at read time.
        </td>

        <!-- MongoDB -->
        <td>
            MongoDB relies on locks for consistency. As of version 2.2, MongoDB has a DB Level Lock for all operations.
            <ul>
                <li>[[Locks|http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/administration/monitoring/#locks]]</li>

    <tr>
        <td><strong>Replication</strong></td>

        <!-- Riak -->
        <td>
            Riak's replication system is heavily influenced by the Dynamo Paper and Dr. Eric Brewer's CAP Theorem. Riak uses consistent hashing to replicate and distribute N copies of each value around a Riak cluster composed of any number of physical machines. Under the hood, Riak uses virtual nodes to handle the distribution and dynamic rebalancing of data, thus decoupling the data distribution from physical assets.
            
            <ul>
              <li>[[Replication]]</li>
              <li>[[Clustering|Clusters]]</li>
            </ul>

            The Riak APIs expose tunable consistency and availability parameters that let you select which level of configuration is best for your use case. Replication is configurable at the bucket level when first storing data in Riak. Subsequent reads and writes to that data can have request-level parameters.

        </td>
        
        <!-- MongoDB -->
        <td>
            Mongo manages replication via replica sets, a form of asynchronous master/slave replication. Traditional master/slave replication is available but not recommended.

    <tr>
        <td><strong>Scaling Out and In</strong></td>

        <!-- Riak -->
        <td>
            Riak allows you to [[elastically grow and shrink|Adding and Removing Nodes]] your cluster while evenly balancing the load on each machine. No node in Riak is special or has any particular role. In other words, all nodes are masterless. When you add a physical machine to Riak, the cluster is made aware of its membership via gossiping of [[ring state|Clusters#the-ring]]. Once it's a member of the ring, it's assigned an equal percentage of the partitions and subsequently takes ownership of the data belonging to those partitions. The process for removing a machine is the inverse of this. Riak also ships with a comprehensive suite of [[command line tools|riak-admin Command Line]] to help make node operations simple and straightforward.
        </td>

        <!-- MongoDB -->
        <td>
            Mongo relies on sharding for scaling out. This involves designating a certain server to hold certain chunks of the data as the data set grows.

                <li>[[Sharding in MongoDB|http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding]]</li>

            </ul>

            To scale in, MongoDB has support for removing shards from your database.

            Riak features two distinct types of [[replication]]. Users can replicate to any number of nodes in one cluster (which is usually contained within one datacenter over a LAN) using the Apache 2.0-licensed database. Riak Enterprise, Basho's commercial extension to Riak, is required for Multi-Datacenter deployments (meaning the ability to run active Riak clusters in N datacenters).
