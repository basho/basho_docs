An introduction to eventual consistency and what it means in terms of handling data with Riak.

In a distributed and fault-tolerant environment like Riak, server and network failures are expected. Riak is designed to respond to requests even when servers are offline or the cluster is experiencing a network partition.

This has two notable consequences:

* Requests can (and should) be tuned based on data model and business needs.
* Data can be inconsistent across a cluster.

<div class="note">
Data inconsistencies can best be mitigated by immutability. Conflicting data is impossible in the absence of updates.
</div>

## Replication Properties and Request Tuning

There is a variety of configuration options which will influence Riak's behavior when responding to write and read requests.

The parameters that we're concerned with:

Parameter | Often referred to as | Default Value | Summary
:---------|:---------------------|:--------------|:-------
`n_val` | **N** | `3` | Replication factor
`r` | **R** | `quorum` | The number of servers that must respond to a read request
`w` | **W**| `quorum` | The number of servers that must respond to a write request
`pr` | **PR** | `0` | The number of _primary_ servers that must respond to a read request
`pw` | **PW** | `0` | The number of _primary_ servers that must respond to a write request

A value of `quorum` indicates a majority of the `N` value (`N`/2 + 1, or 2 for a default `N` value of 3, 3 for an `N` value of 5, 4 for 6, and so on).

There are additional configuration items that are closely related to the above which are not covered in this document: `notfound_ok`, `basic_quorum` and `dw`. See the [Understanding Riak's Configurable Behaviors blog series](http://basho.com/understanding-riaks-configurable-behaviors-part-1/) for more on all of these parameters.

See also the documentation on [[vector clocks]] for a discussion of key configuration options that impact conflict resolution.

## A Simple Example of Eventual Consistency

_Unless specified otherwise, assume that all configuration values are left at their default._

Let's assume for the moment that a server in a Riak cluster has recently recovered from failure and has an old copy of the key `manchester-manager` stored in it, with the value `Alex Ferguson`. The current value of that key on the other servers in the cluster is `David Moyes`.

Shortly after the server comes back online and other cluster members recognize that it is available, a read request for `manchester-manager` arrives.

Such a request would have an `R` value of 2, meaning that while the request will be sent to all `N` (3 in this case) servers responsible for the data, 2 must reply with a value before the client is informed of its value.

Regardless of which order the responses arrive to the server that is coordinating this request, `David Moyes` will be returned as the value to the client, because `Alex Ferguson` is recognized as an older value.

Behind the scenes, after `David Moyes` is sent to the client, a read repair mechanism will occur on the cluster to fix the older value on the server that just came back online.

### R=1

If we keep all of the above scenario the same but tweak the request slightly with `R=1`, perhaps to allow for a faster response to the client, it _is_ possible that the client will be fed `Alex Ferguson` as the response, if the recently recovered server is the first to reply.

However, the read repair mechanism will kick in and fix the value, so the
next time someone asks for the value of `manchester-manager`, `David Moyes` will indeed be the answer.

### R=1, sloppy quorum

Let's take the scenario back in time to the point at which our unlucky server originally failed. At that point, all 3 servers had `Alex Ferguson` as the value for `manchester-manager`.

When a server fails, Riak's *sloppy quorum* feature kicks in and another server takes responsibility for serving its requests.

The first time we issue a read request after the failure, if `R` is set to 1, we run a significant risk of receiving a `not found` response from Riak. The server that has assumed responsibility for that data won't have a copy of `manchester-manager` yet, and it's much faster to verify a missing key than to pull a copy of the value from disk, so that server will likely respond fastest.

If `R` is left to its default value of 2, there wouldn't be a problem because 1 of the servers that still had a copy of `Alex Ferguson` would also respond before the client got its result. In either case, read repair will step in after the request has been completed and make certain that the value is propagated to all the servers that need it.

### PR, PW, sloppy quorum

Thus far, we've discussed settings that permit sloppy quorums in the interest of allowing Riak to maintain as high a level of availability as possible in the presence of server or network failure.

It is possible to configure requests to ignore sloppy quorums in order to limit the possibility of older data being returned to a client. The tradeoff, of course, is that there is an increased risk of request failures if failover servers are not permitted to serve requests.

In the scenario we've been discussing, for example, the possibility of a server for the `manchester-manager` key having failed, but to be more precise, we've been talking about a *primary* server, one that when the cluster is perfectly healthy would bear responsibility for that key.

When that server failed, using `R=2` as we've discussed or even `R=3` for a read request would still work properly: a failover server (sloppy quorum again) would be tasks to take responsibility for that key, and when it receives a request for it, it would reply that it doesn't have any such key, but the two surviving primary servers still know who the `manchester-manager` is.

However, if the `PR` (primary read) value is specified, only the two surviving primary servers are considered valid sources for that data.

So, setting `PR` to 2 works fine, because there are still 2 such servers, but a read request with `PR=3` would fail because the 3rd primary server is offline, and no failover server can take its place *as a primary*.

The same is true of writes: `W=2` or `W=3` will work fine with the primary server offline, as will `PW=2` (primary write), but `PW=3` will result in an error.

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Errors and Failures</div>
It is important to understand the difference between an error and a failure.

The <tt>PW=3</tt> request in this scenario will result in an error, <strong>but the value will still be written to the two surviving primary servers</strong>.

By specifying <tt>PW=3</tt> the client indicated that 3 primary servers must respond for the operation to be considered successful, which it wasn't, but there's no way to tell without performing another read whether the operation truly failed.
