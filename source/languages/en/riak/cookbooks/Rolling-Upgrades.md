<!-- To avoid downtime of a Riak cluster we suggest performing upgrades in a rolling
fashion. This process involves stopping, upgrading, and restarting one node at a
time. This process is known to work as of Riak 0.13 (i.e. upgrading 0.13 or 0.14
to 1.0).
 -->
Riak nodes now negotiate with each other to determine supported operating modes. This allows clusters containing mixed-versions of Riak to properly interoperate without special configuration, and simplifies rolling upgrades.

In previous Riak versions, users were required to disable new features during the rolling upgrade process, and then enable them after all nodes were upgraded. This is now handled automatically by Riak.

[[Upgrading from Riak Search]] before performing a rolling upgrade.</p>

<div class="note"><div class="title">Note on upgrading to Riak 1.0</div>
<p>Rolling upgrades should work when moving from Riak 0.13 or later to Riak 1.0
following the OS specific instructions below, but there are a few considerations
to keep in mind when doing so. Riak 1.0 has new features that add additional
steps to the rolling upgrade procedure, specifically Riak Pipe, the new data
processing library backing MapReduce, and the updated backend API supporting
asynchronous keylisting. If these features are not explicitly enabled after
upgrading, the legacy variant of the feature will be used instead. These
features can only be enabled once *all* nodes in the cluster have been upgraded
to 1.0.</p>

<p>Before starting an upgrade to 1.0 issue the following command on each
pre-1.0.0 node in the cluster to make the transfers command report correctly.
Use `riak attach`if you are not already on the riak console.</p>

```erlang
> riak_core_node_watcher:service_up(riak_pipe, self()).
```

<p>If you forget (or any of the pre-1.0.0 nodes are restarted) it is safe to
re-issue the command.</p>

<p>After upgrading to 1.0, make sure to follow steps 9 and 10 of the applicable
platform specific
instructions.</p>

## Debian/Ubuntu

The following example demonstrates upgrading a Riak node that has been installed
with the Debian packages provided by Basho.

1\. Stop Riak

```bash
riak stop
```


2\. Backup Riak etc and data directories

```bash
sudo tar -czf riak_backup.tar.gz /var/lib/riak /etc/riak
```


3\. Upgrade Riak

```bash
sudo dpkg -i <riak_package_name>.deb
```


4\. Restart Riak

```bash
riak start
```


5\. Verify Riak is running the new version

```bash
riak-admin status
```


6\. Wait for the riak_kv service to start

```bash
riak-admin wait-for-service riak_kv <target_node>
```


* &lt;target_node&gt; is the node which you have just upgraded (e.g.
riak@192.168.1.11)

7\. Wait for any hinted handoff transfers to complete

```bash
riak-admin transfers
```


* While the node was offline other nodes may have accepted writes on it's
behalf. This data is transferred to the node when it becomes available.

8\. Repeat the process for the remaining nodes in the cluster

{{#1.1.0-}}

<div class="note">Only perform the following two steps if you are upgrading to
Riak 1.0 from an earlier release.
</div>

9\. Once all nodes have been upgraded, make the following additions to the
`app.config` file in /etc/riak on each node. First add to the `riak_kv` section:

```erlang
{legacy_keylisting, false},
{mapred_system, pipe},
{vnode_vclocks, true}
```

and then add to the `riak_core` section:

```erlang
{platform_data_dir, "/var/lib/riak"}
```

10\. Either run `riak stop` followed by `riak start` on all of the nodes in
the cluster or use `riak attach` on each node and execute the following
commands:

```erlang
> application:set_env(riak_kv, legacy_keylisting, false).
> application:set_env(riak_kv, mapred_system, pipe).
> application:set_env(riak_kv, vnode_vclocks, true).
```

## Solaris/OpenSolaris

The following example demonstrates upgrading a Riak node that has been installed
with the Solaris/OpenSolaris packages provided by Basho.

1\. Stop Riak

```bash
riak stop
```



<div class="note">If you are using the service management facility (SMF) to
manage Riak you will have to stop Riak via "svcadm" instead of using "riak
stop":
<br /><br />
```bash
sudo svcadm disable riak
```
</div>


2\. Backup Riak etc and data directories

```bash
sudo gtar -czf riak_backup.tar.gz /opt/riak/data /opt/riak/etc
```


3\. Uninstall Riak

```bash
sudo pkgrm BASHOriak
```


4\. Install the new version of Riak

```bash
sudo pkgadd -d <riak_package_name>.pkg
```

{{#1.1.0-}}

the etc directory from the backups made in step 2. The 0.12 package removes the
etc files when uninstalled.</div>
{{/1.1.0-}}

4\. Restart Riak

```bash
riak start
```

<div class="note">If you are using the SMF you should start Riak via "svcadm":
