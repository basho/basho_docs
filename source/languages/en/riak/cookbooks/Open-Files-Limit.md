Riak can consume a large number of open file handles during normal operation. In particular, the Bitcask backend may accumulate a number of data files before it has a chance to run a merge process. You can count the number of data files in the bitcask directory with following command:

```bash
ls data/bitcask/*/* | wc -l
```

Please note that the creation of numerous data files is normal. Each time Riak is started Bitcask creates a new data file per partition; every so often Bitcask will merge a collection of data files into a single file to avoid accumulating file handles. It’s possible to artificially inflate the number of file handles Bitcask uses by repeatedly writing data and restarting Riak. The shell command below illustrates this issue:

```bash
for i in {1..100}
  do
    riak stop
    riak start
    sleep 3
    curl http://localhost:8098/riak/test -X POST -d "x" \
      -H "Content-Type: text/plain"
    ls data/bitcask/*/* | wc -l
done
```

## Changing the limit
Most operating systems can change the open-files limit using the `ulimit -n` command. Example:

```bash
ulimit -n 1024
```

However, this only changes the limit for the **current shell session**. Changing the limit on a system-wide, permanent basis varies more between systems.

## Linux
On most Linux distributions, the total limit for open files is controlled by `sysctl`.

```bash
sysctl fs.file-max
fs.file-max = 50384
```

As seen above, it is generally set high enough for Riak. If you have other things running on the system, you might want to consult the [[sysctl manpage|http://linux.die.net/man/8/sysctl]] for how to change that setting. However, what most needs to be changed is the per-user open files limit. This requires editing /etc/security/limits.conf, which you’ll need superuser access to change. If you installed Riak or Riak Search from a binary package, add lines for the riak user like so, substituting your desired hard and soft limits:

On Ubuntu, if you’re always relying on the init scripts to start Riak, you can create the file /etc/default/riak and specify a manual limit like so:

```bash
ulimit -n 4096
```

This file is automatically sourced from the init script, and the Riak process started by it will properly inherit this setting. As init scripts are always run as the root user, there’s no need to specifically set limits in /etc/security/limits.conf if you’re solely relying on init scripts.

On CentOS/RedHat systems make sure to set a proper limit for the user you’re usually logging in with to do any kind of work on the machine, including managing Riak. On CentOS, sudo properly inherits the values from the executing user.

### Enabling PAM Based User Limits
It can be helpful to enable PAM user limits so that non-root users, such as the riak user may specify a higher value for maximum open files. For example, to enable PAM user limits and set the soft and hard values for all non-root users to 8192 open files, follow these steps:

  1. Edit `/etc/pam.d/su` and remove the comment on this line:

         #session    required   pam_limits.so

     so that it resembles this line:

         session    required   pam_limits.so

  2. Save and close the file

  3. Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf`, and append the following lines to the file:

         riak               soft     nofile          8192
         riak               hard     nofile          8192

  4. Save and close the file

  5. Restart the machine so that the limits to take effect, and verify with the command: `ulimit -a`.

## Solaris
In Solaris 8, there is a default limit of 1024 file descriptors per process. In Solaris 9, the default limit was raised to 65536. To increase the per-process limit on Solaris, add the following line to `/etc/system`:

```bash
set rlim_fd_max=65536
```

## Mac OS X
To check the current limits on your Mac OS X system, run (the final two columns are the soft and hard limits, respectively):

```bash
launchctl limit maxfiles 2048 unlimited
```

This will set the limit until the next time you reboot. To make the change permanent add the line below to `/etc/launchd.conf` (superuser access required):

```bash
limit maxfiles 2048 unlimited
```

**Note:** Snow Leopard (10.6) may not allow “unlimited” for the maxfiles setting, in which case, just omit it.

### OS X 10.7 (Lion)
To adjust the maximum open file limits in OS X 10.7 (Lion), edit `/etc/launchd.conf`, and increase the limits for both values as appropriate.

For example, to set the soft limit to 16384 files, and the hard limit to 32768 files, perform the following steps:

Verify current limits:

```bash
launchctl limit

    cpu         unlimited      unlimited
    filesize    unlimited      unlimited
    data        unlimited      unlimited
    stack       8388608        67104768
    core        0              unlimited
    rss         unlimited      unlimited
    memlock     unlimited      unlimited
    maxproc     709            1064
    maxfiles    10240          10240
```

Edit `/etc/launchd.conf` (if the file does not exist, create it), and increase the limits, so that it resembles the following values, being sure to use values specific to your environment or as directed:

```bash
limit maxfiles 16384 32768
```

Save the file, and restart the system for the new limits to take effect. After restarting, verify the new limits with the launchctl limit command:

```bash
launchctl limit

    cpu         unlimited      unlimited
    filesize    unlimited      unlimited
    data        unlimited      unlimited
    stack       8388608        67104768
    core        0              unlimited
    rss         unlimited      unlimited
    memlock     unlimited      unlimited
    maxproc     709            1064
    maxfiles    16384          32768
```
