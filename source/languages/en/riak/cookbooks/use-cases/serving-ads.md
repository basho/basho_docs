## Simple Case

A common use case for Riak is using it as a data store for serving ad content to many different web and mobile users with low latency. In Riak, advertising content - images or text - can be stored with unique keys, or with Riak-generated keys. Users will often make keys based on a campaign ID for easy retrieval.  

## Complex Case

In the advertising industry, being able to serve ads quickly to many users and platforms is often the most important factor in selecting and tuning a database. Riak's tunable CAP controls can be set to favor fast read performance. By setting the r value to 1, only one of n replicas will need to be returned to complete a read operation, yielding lower read latency than a r value equal to the number of replicas. This is ideal for advertising traffic which is primarily serving reads.

    Los Angeles-based OpenX will serve around four trillion ads this year. In this talk, Anthony Molinaro, Engineer at OpenX, goes in-depth on their architecture, how they've built their system, and why/how they are switching to Riak and Riak Core for data storage after using databases like CouchDB and Cassandra in production.
