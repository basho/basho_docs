*Welcome, new Riak developer!*

This guide will get you started developing against Riak with minimal fuss.

### Installing Riak

If you haven't completed the [[five minute install]], go ahead and walk through it. If you only want to code against a single node, you can instead [[download|downloads]] the package for your operating system, install it, and start it up (by running the `riak start` command).

###Choose Your Programming Language

Basho officially supports a number of open-source [[client libraries]] for various programming languages and environments.  Please select the language you'd like to proceed with.
