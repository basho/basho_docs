If you haven't set up a Riak Node and started it, please visit the [[Prerequisites|Taste of Riak: Prerequisites]] first.

To try this flavor of Riak, a working installation of Python is
required, with Python 2.7 preferred. One of the Python package
managers `setuptools` or `pip` is also required to install the client
package.

You may install `setuptools` on OS/X through MacPorts by running `sudo
port install py-distribute`. `setuptools` and `pip` are included in
the Homebrew formula for Python on OS/X: `brew install python`.

### Client Setup

The easiest way to install the client is with `easy_install` or `pip`.
Either of the commands below will ensure that the client and all its
dependencies are installed and on the load path. Depending on where
your Python libraries are held, these may require `sudo`.

```bash
easy_install riak
pip install riak
```

To install from source, download the latest python client from GitHub
([zip](https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client/archive/master.zip),
[github repository](https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client)), and
extract it to your working directory.

Now, let's build the client.

```bash
python setup.py install
```

### Connecting to Riak

Now, let's start the Python REPL and get set up.  Enter the following into the Python REPL:

```python
import riak
```
If you are using a single local Riak node, use the following to create a new client instance:

```python
myClient = riak.RiakClient(pb_port=8087, protocol='pbc')
```

If you set up a local Riak cluster using the [[five minute install]] method, use this code snippet instead:

```python
myClient = riak.RiakClient(pb_port=10017, protocol='pbc')
```

We are now ready to start interacting with Riak.


###Creating Objects In Riak
First, let’s create a few objects and a bucket to keep them in.

```python
myBucket = myClient.bucket('test')

val1 = 1
key1 = myBucket.new('one', data=val1)
key1.store()
```

In this first example we have stored the integer 1 with the lookup key of ‘one’.  Next let’s store a simple string value of “two” with a matching key.

```python
val2 = "two"
key2 = myBucket.new('two', data=val2)
key2.store()
```

That was easy.  Finally, let’s store a bit of JSON.  You will probably recognize the pattern by now.

```python
val3 = {"myValue": 3}
key3 = myBucket.new('three', data=val3)
key3.store()
```

###Reading Objects From Riak
Now that we have a few objects stored, let’s retrieve them and make sure they contain the values we expect.

```python
fetched1 = myBucket.get('one')
fetched2 = myBucket.get('two')
fetched3 = myBucket.get('three')

assert val1 == fetched1.data
assert val2 == fetched2.data
assert val3 == fetched3.data
```

That was easy.  We simply request the objects by key.

###Updating Objects In Riak
While some data may be static, other forms of data may need to be updated.  This is also easy to accomplish.  Let’s update the value of myValue in the 3rd example to 42.

```python
fetched3.data["myValue"] = 42
fetched3.store()
```

###Deleting Objects From Riak
Nothing is complete without a delete, fortunately that's easy too.

```python
fetched1.delete()
fetched2.delete()
fetched3.delete()
```

Now we can verify that the objects have been removed from Riak.

```python
assert myBucket.get('one').exists == False
assert myBucket.get('two').exists == False
assert myBucket.get('three').exists == False
```


###Working With Complex Objects
Since the world is a little more complicated than simple integers and bits of strings, let’s see how we can work with more complex objects.  Take for example, this object that encapsulates some knowledge about a book.

```python
book = {
  'isbn': "1111979723",
  'title': "Moby Dick",
  'author': "Herman Melville",
  'body': "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...",
  'copies_owned': 3 
}
```

Ok, so we have some information about our Moby Dick collection that we want to save.  Storing this to Riak should look familiar by now:

```python
booksBucket = myClient.bucket('books')
newBook = booksBucket.new(book['isbn'], data=book)
newBook.store()
```

Some of you may be thinking “But how does the Python Riak client encode/decode my object”?  If we fetch our book back and print the raw encoded data, we shall know:

```python
fetchedBook = booksBucket.get(book['isbn'])

print(fetchedBook.encoded_data)
```

```javascript
{"body": "Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...",
"author": "Herman Melville", "isbn": "1111979723",
"copies_owned": 3, "title": "Moby Dick"}
```

JSON!  The Riak Python client library encodes things as JSON when it can.  If we wanted to get a deserialized object back we would just use the regular `fetchedBook.data` method.

Finally let’s clean up our mess:

```python
fetchedBook.delete()
```

###Next Steps
More complex use cases can be composed from these initial create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. In the next chapter we will look at how to store and query more complicated and interconnected data, such as documents.
