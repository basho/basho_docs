As a developer, you may be nonplussed to see that Secondary Indexes (2i)
don't work with the Bitcask backend. You may also be wondering how to
work with "sets" of data.

In this chapter, we'll cover how to deal with both, and in the next
chapter we'll introduce some important distributed systems concepts such
as [[siblings|Vector Clocks#Siblings]], [[eventual consistency]], and
[[sibling resolution|Vector Clocks#Siblings]] that you'll need to know
to become a pro Riak developer.

For the remainder of the tutorials, we will be implementing pieces of an
internal messaging app. This app, codenamed "Msgy" (we couldn't afford
all the vowels) will provide "a way to incentivize long-tail watercooler
networking for employees." In short, it will allow us to post little
snippets of text (Msgs) to each other at work without all the hassle of
email, while we block traditional social media.

At the data level, we only have a few objects to work with:

* `User` --- A user object, containing a `user_name`, a `full_name`, and
   an `email` address.
* `Msg` --- A message that a user has sent, containing `text`, `sender`
  and `recipient` addresses, and a `created` date.
* `Timeline` --- A list of `Msg`s, containing an `owner` and a
  `msg_type`.  The type can be one of two things:
  * `Inbox`: A user's inbox of personal messages, or a group's public Msg list.
  * `Sent`: A list of a user's sent messages.

The `Timeline` objects could easily be implemented with a 2i query
across the `Msg` bucket, but in this chapter we'll show how to do it
using only key/value operations.
