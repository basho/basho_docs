Interacting with objects in Riak typically involves the same CRUD
(**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete) operations that you'd
find in any key/value store.

## Object/Key Operations

Riak organizes data into bucket types, buckets, keys, and values, with
[[bucket types|Using Bucket Types]] acting as an additional namespace in
Riak versions 2.0 and greater. Values (or objects) are identifiable by a
unique key, and each key/value pair is stored in a bucket.

Buckets are essentially a flat namespace in Riak. You can name them
whatever you'd like, even `bucket` or `a90bf521c` or `___` or `:)`. They
have no intrinsic significance beyond allowing you to store objects with
the same key in different buckets (the same goes for naming keys).
Buckets do, however, enable you to provide common configurations to the
keys and values within them, such as [[replication properties]] and
[[commit hooks|Using Commit Hooks]]. Such [[properties|Buckets]] are
managed using bucket types.

Most of the interactions you'll have with Riak will involve setting or
retrieving the value of a key. Riak has [[supported client
libraries|Client Libraries]] for Erlang, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby and
C/C++. In addition, there are [[community-supported projects|Client
Libraries#Community-Libraries]] for .NET, Node.js, Python, Perl,
Clojure, Scala, Smalltalk, and many others.

### Read an Object

Here is the basic command form for retrieving a specific key from a
bucket:

```
GET /types/TYPE/buckets/BUCKET/keys/KEY
```

Here is an example of a read performed on the key `rufus` in the bucket
`dogs`, which bears the type `animals`:

```java
// In the Java client, it is best to specify a bucket type/bucket/key
// Location object that can be used as a reference for further
// operations:

Location myKey = new Location(new Namespace("animals", "dogs"), "rufus");
```

```ruby
bucket = client.bucket_type('animals').bucket('dogs')
obj = bucket.get('rufus')
```

```python
bucket = client.bucket_type('animals').bucket('dogs')
obj = bucket.get('rufus')
```

```php
$bucket = $client->bucketType('animals')->bucket('dogs');
$obj = $bucket->get('rufus');
```

```erlang
{ok, Obj} = riakc_pb_socket:get(Pid,
                            {<<"animals">>, <<"dogs">>},
                            <<"rufus">>).
```

```curl
curl http://localhost:8098/types/animals/buckets/dogs/keys/rufus
```

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Getting started with Riak clients</div>
If you are connecting to Riak using one of Basho's official [[client
libraries]], you can find more information about getting started with
your client in our [[quickstart guide|Five-Minute
Install#setting-up-your-riak-client]].
</div>

If there is no object stored under that particular key, Riak will return
a message indicating that the object doesn't exist.

```java
java.lang.NullPointerException
```

```ruby
Riak::ProtobuffsFailedRequest: Expected success from Riak but received not_found. The requested object was not found.
```

```python
riak.RiakError: 'no_type'
```

```php

```

```erlang
{error,notfound}
```

```curl
not found
```

If you're using HTTP to interact with Riak, as opposed to using a
[[client library|Client Libraries]], Riak understands many HTTP-defined
headers, such as `Accept` for content-type negotiation, which is
relevant when dealing with siblings (see [[the sibling examples for the
HTTP API|HTTP Fetch Object#Siblings-examples]]), and
`If-None-Match`/`ETag` and `If-Modified-Since`/`Last-Modified` for
conditional requests.

#### Read Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
:---------|:--------|:-----------
`r` | `2` | How many replicas need to agree when retrieving an existing object before the write
`pr` | `0` | How many [[vnodes]] must respond for a read to be deemed successful
`notfound_ok` | If set to `true`, if the first vnode to respond doesn't have a copy of the object, Riak will deem the failure authoritative and immediately return a `notfound` error to the client

Riak also accepts many query parameters, including `r` for setting the
R-value for GET requests (R values describe how many replicas need to
agree when retrieving an existing object in order to return a successful
response).

Here is an example of attempting a read with `r` set to `3`:

```java
// Using the "myKey" location specified above:

FetchValue fetch = new FetchValue.Builder(myKey)
        .withOption(FetchOption.R, new Quorum(3))
        .build();
FetchValue.Response response = client.execute(fetch);
RiakObject obj = response.getValue(RiakObject.class);
```

```ruby
bucket = client.bucket_type('animals').bucket('dogs')
obj = bucket.get('rufus', r: 3)
```

```python
bucket = client.bucket_type('animals').bucket('dogs')
obj = bucket.get('rufus', r=3)
obj.data
```

```php
$bucket = $client->bucketType('animals')->bucket('dogs');
$obj = $bucket->get('rufus', $r => 3);
```

```erlang
{ok, Obj} = riakc_pb_socket:get(Pid,
                                {<<"animals">>, <<"dogs">>},
                                <<"rufus">>,
                                [{r, 3}]).
```

```curl
curl http://localhost:8098/types/animals/buckets/dogs/keys/rufus?r=3
```

If you're using HTTP, you will most often see the following response
codes:

* `200 OK`
* `300 Multiple Choices`
* `304 Not Modified`

The most common error code:

* `404 Not Found`

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Note</div>
If you're using a Riak client instead of HTTP, these responses will vary
a great deal, so make sure to check the documentation for your specific
client.
</div>

### Store an Object

Your application will often have its own method of generating the keys
for its data, e.g. on the basis of timestamps. If so, storing that data
is easy. The basic request looks like this.

```
PUT /types/TYPE/buckets/BUCKET/keys/KEY
```

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Note</div>
If you're using HTTP, <tt>POST</tt> is also a valid method, for
compatibility's sake.
</div>

There is no need to intentionally create buckets in Riak. They pop into
existence when keys are added to them, and disappear when all keys have
been removed from them. If you don't specify a bucket's type, the type
`[[default|Using Bucket Types]]` will be applied.

#### Specifying Content Type

For all writes to Riak, you will need to specify a content type, for
example `text/plain` or `application/json`.

```java
Location wildeGeniusQuote = new Location(new Namespace("quotes", "oscar_wilde"), "genius");
BinaryValue text = BinaryValue.create("I have nothing to declare but my genius");
RiakObject obj = new RiakObject()
        .setContentType("text/plain")
        .setValue(text);
StoreValue store = new StoreValue.Builder(myKey, obj)
        .build();
client.execute(store);
```

```ruby
bucket = client.bucket_type('quotes').bucket('oscar_wilde')
obj = Riak::RObject.new(bucket, 'genius')
obj.content_type = 'text/plain'
obj.raw_data = 'I have nothing to declare but my genius'
obj.store
```

```python
bucket = client.bucket_type('quotes').bucket('oscar_wilde')
obj = RiakObject(client, bucket, 'genius')
obj.content_type = 'text/plain'
obj.data = 'I have nothing to declare but my genius'
obj.store()
```

```php
$bucket = $client->bucketType("quotes")->bucket("oscar_wilde");
$obj = new Basho\Riak\Object($client, $bucket, "genius");
$obj->setContentType("text/plain");
$obj->setData("I have nothing to declare but my genius");
$obj->store();
```

```erlang
Object = riakc_obj:new({<<"quotes">>, <<"oscar_wilde">>},
                       <<"genius">>,
                       <<"I have nothing to declare but my genius">>,
                       <<"text/plain">>).
riakc_pb_socket:put(Pid, Object).
```

```curl
curl -XPUT \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "I have nothing to declare but my genius" \
  http://localhost:8098/types/quotes/buckets/oscar_wilde/keys/genius
```

#### Using Causal Context

If an object already exists under a certain key and you want to write a
new object to that key, Riak needs to know what to do, especially if
multiple writes are happening at the same time. Which of the objects
being written should be deemed correct? These kinds of scenarios can
arise quite frequently in distributed, [[eventually consistent|Eventual
Consistency]] systems.

Riak decides which object to choose in case of conflict using [[causal
context]]. These objects track the causal history of objects.
They are attached to _all_ Riak objects as metadata, and they are not
readable by humans. They may sound complex---and they are fairly complex
behind the scenes---but using them in your application is very simple.

Whenever you perform updates in Riak

Using causal context in an update would involve the following steps;

1. Fetch the object
2. Modify the object's value (without modifying the fetched [[context
   object|Causal Context]])
3. Write the new object to Riak

Step 2 is the most important here. All of Basho's official Riak clients
enable you to modify an object's value without modifying its [[causal
context]]. Although a more detailed tutorial on context objects and
object updates can be found in [[Conflict Resolution]], we'll walk you
through a basic example here.

Let's say that the current NBA champion is the Washington Generals.
We've stored that data in Riak under the key `champion` in the bucket
`nba`, which bears the bucket type `sports`. The value of the object is
a simple text snippet that says `Washington Generals`.

But one day the Harlem Globetrotters enter the league and dethrone the
hapless Generals (forever, as it turns out). Because we want our Riak
database to reflect this new development in the league, we want to make
a new write to the `champion` key. Let's read the object stored there
and modify the value.

```java
Location currentChampion = new Location(new Namespace("sports", "nba"), "champion");
FetchValue fetch = new FetchValue.Builder(currentChampion)
        .build();
FetchValue.Response response = client.execute(fetch);
RiakObject obj = response.getValue(RiakObject.class);
obj.setValue(BinaryValue.create("Harlem Globetrotters"))
```

```ruby
bucket = client.bucket_type('sports').bucket('nba')
obj = bucket.get('champion')
obj.raw_data = 'Harlem Globetrotters'
obj.store
```

```python
bucket = client.bucket_type('sports').bucket('nba')
obj = bucket.get('champion')
obj.data = 'Harlem Globetrotters'
```

```php
$bucket = $client->bucketType("sports")->bucket("nba");
$obj = $bucket->get("champion");
$obj->setData("Harlem Globetrotters");
```

```erlang
%% In the Erlang client, you cannot view a context objectdirectly, but it
%% will be included in the output when you fetch an object:

{ok, Obj} = riakc_pb_socket:get(Pid,
                                {<<"sports">>, <<"nba">>},
                                <<"champion">>),
UpdatedObj = riakc_obj:update_value(Obj, <<"Harlem Globetrotters">>),
{ok, NewestObj} = riakc_pb_socket:put(Pid, UpdatedObj, [return_body]).
```

```curl
# When using curl, the context object is attached to the X-Riak-Vclock header

curl -i http://localhost:8098/types/sports/buckets/nba/keys/champion

# In the resulting output, the header will look something like this:

X-Riak-Vclock: a85hYGBgzGDKBVIcWu/1S4OVPaIymBIZ81gZbskuOMOXBQA=

# When performing a write to the same key, that same header needs to
# accompany the write for Riak to be able to use the context object
```

In the samples above, we didn't need to actually interact with the
context object, as retaining and passing along the context object was
accomplished automatically by the client. If, however, you do need
access to an object's context, the clients enable you to fetch it from
the object:

```java
// Using the RiakObject obj from above:

Vclock vClock = obj.getVclock();
System.out.println(vClock.asString());

// The context object will look something like this:
// a85hYGBgzGDKBVIcWu/1S4OVPaIymBIZ81gZbskuOMOXBQA=
```

```ruby
# Using the RObject obj from above:

obj.vclock

# The context object will look something like this:
# a85hYGBgzGDKBVIcWu/1S4OVPaIymBIZ81gZbskuOMOXBQA=
```

```python
# Using the RiakObject obj from above:

obj.vclock

# The causal context will look something like this:
# a85hYGBgzGDKBVIcWu/1S4OVPaIymBIZ81gZbskuOMOXBQA=
```

```php
// Using the object from above:

$obj->vclock();
```

```erlang
%% Using the Obj object from above:

riakc_obj:vclock(Obj).

%% The context object will look something like this in the Erlang shell:
%% <<107,206,97,96,96,96,204,96,202,5,82,28,202,156,255,126,
%% 6,175,157,255,57,131,41,145,49,143,149,225,240,...>>
```

#### Write Parameters

Similar to how read requests support the `r` query parameter, write
requests also support the following parameters:

Parameter | Default | Description
:---------|:--------|:-----------
`w` | `2` | How many replicas to write to before returning a successful response
`pw` | `0` | How many primary vnodes must respond for a write to be deemed successful
`dw` | `0` | How many replicas to commit to durable storage before returning a successful response
`returnbody` | `false` | Whether to return the contents of the stored object

Here is an example of storing an object (another brief text snippet)
under the key `viper` in the bucket `dodge`, which bears the type
`cars`, with `w` set to `3`:

```java
Location viperKey = new Location(new Namespace("cars", "dodge"), "viper");
BinaryValue text = BinaryValue.create("vroom");
RiakObject obj = new RiakObject()
        .setContentType("text/plain")
        .setValue(text);
StoreValue store = new StoreValue.Builder(myKey, obj)
        .withOption(StoreOption.W, new Quorum(3))
        .build();
client.execute(store);
```

```ruby
bucket = client.bucket_type('cars').bucket('dodge')
obj = Riak::RObject.new(bucket, 'viper')
obj.content_type = 'text/plain'
obj.raw_data = 'vroom'
obj.store(r: 3)
```

```python
bucket = client.bucket_type('cars').bucket('dodge')
obj = RiakObject(client, bucket, 'viper')
obj.content_type = 'text/plain'
obj.data = 'vroom'
obj.store(w=3)
```

```php
$bucket = $client->bucketType("cars")->bucket("dodge");
$obj = new Basho\Riak\Object($client, $bucket, "viper");
$obj->setContentType("text/plain");
$obj->setData("vroom");
$obj->store(3);
```

```erlang
Object = riakc_obj:new({<<"cars">>, <<"dodge">>},
                       <<"viper">>,
                       <<"vroom">>,
                       <<"text/plain">>,
                       [{w, 3}]).
riakc_pb_socket:put(Pid, Object).
```

```curl
curl -XPUT \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "vroom" \
  http://localhost:8098/types/cars/buckets/dodge/keys/viper?w=3
```

Normal HTTP status codes (responses will vary for client libraries):

* `200 OK`
* `204 No Content`
* `300 Multiple Choices`

#### Return Body

If `returnbody` is set to `true`, any of the response headers expected
from a read request may be present. Like a `GET` request, `300 Multiple
Choices` may be returned if siblings existed or were created as part of
the operation, and the response can be dealt with similarly.

Let's give it a shot, using the same object from above:

```java
Location viperKey = new Location(new Namespace("cars", "dodge"), "viper");
BinaryValue text = BinaryValue.create("vroom");
RiakObject obj = new RiakObject()
        .setContentType("text/plain")
        .setValue(text);
StoreValue store = new StoreValue.Builder(myKey, obj)
        .withOption(StoreOption.W, new Quorum(3))
        .withOption(StoreOption.RETURN_BODY, true)
        .build();
client.execute(store);
```

```ruby
bucket = client.bucket_type('cars').bucket('dodge')
obj = Riak::RObject.new(bucket, 'viper')
obj.content_type = 'text/plain'
obj.raw_data = 'vroom'
obj.store(r: 3, returnbody: true)
```

```python
bucket = client.bucket_type('cars').bucket('dodge')
obj = RiakObject(client, bucket, 'viper')
obj.content_type = 'text/plain'
obj.data = 'vroom'
obj.store(w=3, return_body=True)
```

```php
$bucket = $client->bucketType("cars")->bucket("dodge");
$obj = new Basho\Riak\Object($client, $bucket, "viper");
$obj->setContentType("text/plain");
$obj->setData("vroom");
$obj->store(3);
```

```erlang
Object = riakc_obj:new({<<"cars">>, <<"dodge">>},
                       <<"viper">>,
                       <<"vroom">>,
                       <<"text/plain">>).
riakc_pb_socket:put(Pid, Object, [return_body]).
```

```curl
curl -XPUT \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "vroom" \
  http://localhost:8098/types/cars/buckets/dodge/keys/viper?w=3&returnbody=true
```

### Store a New Object and Assign a Random Key

If your application would rather leave key-generation up to Riak, issue
a `POST` request to the bucket URL instead of a PUT to a bucket/key
pair:

```
POST /types/TYPE/buckets/BUCKET/keys
```

If you don't pass Riak a `key` name after the bucket, it will know to
create one for you.

Supported headers are the same as for bucket/key write requests, though
`X-Riak-Vclock` will never be relevant for these POST requests.
Supported query parameters are also the same as for bucket/key PUT
requests.

Normal status codes:

* `201 Created`

This command will store an object in the bucket `random_user_keys`,
which bears the bucket type `users`.

```java
Namespace locationWithoutKey = new Namespace("users", "random_user_keys");
BinaryValue text = BinaryValue.create("{'user':'data'}");
RiakObject obj = new RiakObject()
        .setContentType("application/json")
        .setValue(text);
StoreValue store = new StoreValue.Builder(locationWithoutKey, obj)
        .build();
String key = client.execute(store).getLocation().getKeyAsString();

// The Java client will assign a random key along the following lines:
"ZPFF18PUqGW9efVou7EHhfE6h8a"
```

```ruby
bucket = client.bucket_type('users').bucket('random_user_keys')
obj = Riak::RObject.new(bucket)
obj.content_type = 'application/json'
obj.raw_data = '{"user":"data"}'

obj.store

# The client will assign a key like the following:
obj.key
"GB8fW6DDZtXogK19OLmaJf247DN"
```

```python
bucket = client.bucket_type('users').bucket('random_user_keys')
obj = RiakObject(client, bucket)
obj.content_type = 'application/json'
obj.data = '{"user":"data"}'
obj.store()

obj.key

# The Python client will assign a random key along the following lines:
'ZPFF18PUqGW9efVou7EHhfE6h8a'
```

```php
$bucket = $client->bucketType("users")->bucket("random_user_keys");
// The newObject() convenience method creates a JSON object by default
// and automatically sets the content type to application/json:
$obj = $bucket->newObject(null, array('user' => "data"));
$obj->store();
```

```erlang
Object = riakc_obj:new({<<"users">>, <<"random_user_keys">>}, undefined, <<"{'user':'data'}">>, <<"application/json">>).
riakc_pb_socket:put(Pid, Object).

%% The key can be retrieved from the output of the above call.
%% It will look something like this:

{ok,{riakc_obj,{<<"users">>,<<"random_user_keys">>},
               <<"EZ7pp4bpdfpZw0fPUdTUafveQjO">>,undefined,[],undefined,
               undefined}}
```

```curl
curl -i -XPOST \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "this is a test" \
  http://localhost:8098/types/users/buckets/random_user_keys/keys

# In the output, you should see a Location header that will give you the
# location of the object in Riak, with the key at the end:

Location: /buckets/test/keys/G7FYUXtTsEdru4NP32eijMIRK3o
```

### Delete an Object

The delete command follows a predictable pattern and looks like this:

```
DELETE /types/TYPE/buckets/BUCKET/keys/KEY
```

The normal HTTP response codes for `DELETE` operations are `204 No
Content` and `404 Not Found`. 404 responses are *normal*, in the sense
that `DELETE` operations are idempotent and not finding the resource has
the same effect as deleting it.

Let's try to delete our `genius` key from the `oscar_wilde` bucket
(which bears the type `quotes`) from above.

```java
Location geniusQuote = new Location(new Namespace("quotes", "oscar_wilde"), "genius");
DeleteValue delete = new DeleteValue.Builder(geniusQuote).build();
client.execute(delete);
```

```ruby
bucket = client.bucket_type('quotes').bucket('oscar_wilde')
bucket.delete('genius')
```

```python
bucket = client.bucket_type('quotes').bucket('oscar_wilde')
bucket.delete('genius')
```

```php
$bucket = $client->bucketType("quotes")->bucket("oscar_wilde");
$bucket->delete("genius");
```

```erlang
riakc_pb_socket:delete(Pid, {<<"quotes">>, <<"oscar_wilde">>}, <<"genius">>)
```

```curl
curl -XDELETE http://localhost:8098/types/quotes/buckets/oscar_wilde/keys/genius
```

## Updating Objects

Updating objects tends to be a bit trickier than reading and writing
objects. We recommend checking out our documentation on [[object
updates]] for a full tutorial, including code samples from our [[client
libraries]].

## Bucket Properties and Operations

Buckets are essentially a flat namespace in Riak. They allow the same
key name to exist in multiple buckets and enable you to apply
configurations across keys.

<div class="info">
<div class="title">How Many Buckets Can I Have?</div>
Buckets come with virtually no cost <em>except for when you modify the
default bucket properties</em>. Modified bucket properties are gossiped
around the cluster and therefore add to the amount of data sent around
the network. In other words, buckets using the <tt>default</tt> bucket
type are free. More on that in the next section.
</div>

### Bucket Types

A comprehensive tutorial on bucket types can be found in the [[Using
Bucket Types]] document. Here, we'll discuss some basic parameters that
can be managed using bucket types.

Here are some important bucket properties to be aware of:

Parameter | Description | Default
:---------|:------------|:-------
`n_val` | The number of replicas for objects in a bucket. The `n_val` should be an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to the number of nodes in the cluster.<br /><br />**Note**: If you change the `n_val` after keys have been added to the bucket, it may result in failed reads, as the new value may not be replicated to all of the appropriate partitions.| `3`
`allow_mult` | With `allow_mult` set to `false`, clients will never be presented with siblings upon read. Though siblings will often be created in Riak during concurrent writes or network partitions even if `allow_mult` is set to `false`, only the most recent object as determined by timestamp will be presented to the client. If this parameter is set to `true`, Riak will present sibling objects to the client, which will then be responsible for resolving the confict. | `true`
`last_write_wins` | If `allow_mult` is set to `false`, setting `last_write_wins` to `true`, Riak will _always_ overwrite existing objects and will ignore the timestamps associated with those objects. | `false`

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Note</div>
Setting both <code>allow_mult</code> and <code>last_write_wins</code> to
<code>true</code> necessarily leads to unpredictable behavior and should
always be avoided.
</div>

As an example, let's create a bucket type called `n_val_of_5` that sets
the `n_val` to 5:

```bash
riak-admin bucket-type create n_val_of_5 '{"props":{"n_val":5}}'
```

We must activate the type for those parameters to take effect:

```bash
riak-admin bucket-type activate n_val_of_5
```

Once the type is activated, we can see which properties are associated
with our bucket type (and, by extension, any bucket that bears that
type):

```java
// Fetching the bucket properties of a bucket type/bucket combination
// must be done using a RiakCluster object rather than a RiakClient.
Namespace testType = new Namespace("n_val_of_5", "any_bucket_name");
FetchBucketPropsOperation fetchProps = new FetchBucketPropsOperation
        .Builder(testType)
        .build();
cluster.execute(fetchProps);
BucketProperties props = fetchProps.get().getBucketProperties();
```

```ruby
bt = client.bucket_type('n_val_of_5')
bt.props
```

```python
bt = BucketType(client, 'n_val_of_5')
bt.get_properties()
```

```php
// TODO
```

```erlang
riakc_pb_socket:get_bucket_type(Pid, <<"n_val_of_5">>).
```

```curl
curl http://localhost:8098/types/n_val_of_5/props
```
