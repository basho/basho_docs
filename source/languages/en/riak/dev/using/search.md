<div class="info">This document refers to the new Riak Search 2.0 with [[Solr|http://lucene.apache.org/solr/]] integration (codenamed Yokozuna). For information about the <em>deprecated</em> Riak Search, visit [[the old Using Riak Search|http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.4.8/dev/using/search/]].</div>

You must first [[enable Riak Search|Riak Search Settings]] in your environment to use it.

## Introduction

Riak Search 2.0 is a new open-source project integrated with Riak. It allows for distributed, scalable, fault tolerant, transparent indexing and querying of Riak values. It's easy to use. After connecting a bucket (or bucket type) to a Solr index, you simply write values (such as JSON, XML, plain text, datatypes, etc.) into Riak as normal, and then query those indexed values using the Solr API.

### Why Riak Search

Some of Riak's core strengths lie in its scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of operations. However, Riak models its data in key-value objects, and a key-value store is something that few would claim is easy to query. This is the driving force behind Riak Search, to provide an integrated, scalable mechanism to build ad hoc queries against values stored in a Riak cluster, while holding true to Riak's core strengths.

## Simple Setup

Riak Search 2.0 is an integration of Solr (for indexing and querying) and Riak (for storage and distribution). There are a few points of interest that a user of Riak Search will have to keep in mind in order to properly store and later query for values.

1. **Schemas** explain to Solr how to index fields
2. **Indexes** are named Solr indexes against which you will query
3. **Bucket-index association** signals to Riak *when* to index values

Riak Search must first be configured with a Solr *schema*, so Solr knows how to index value fields. If you don't define one, you're provided with a default schema named `_yz_default`. The examples in this document will presume the default. You can read more about creating a custom schema in [[search schema]], which you'll want to do in a production environment.

Next, you must create a named Solr index through Riak Search. This index represents a collection of similar data that you connect with to perform queries. When creating an index, you can optionally provide a schema. If you do not, the default schema will be used. Here we'll `curl` create an index named `famous` with the default schema.

<div class="info">All `curl` examples in this document require that you first
set an environment variable named `RIAK_HOST`, which points to a Riak base
URL, such as `RIAK_HOST="http://localhost:8098"`.</div>

```curl
export RIAK_HOST="http://localhost:8098"

curl -XPUT "$RIAK_HOST/search/index/famous"
```
```ruby
client.create_search_index("famous")
```
```python
client.create_search_index('famous')
```
```erlang
riakc_pb_socket:create_search_index(Pid, <<"famous">>)
```

Note that the above command is exactly the same as the following, which explicitly defines the default schema.

```curl
curl -XPUT "$RIAK_HOST/search/index/famous" \
     -H'content-type:application/json' \
     -d'{"schema":"_yz_default"}'
```
```ruby
client.create_search_index("famous", "_yz_default")
```
```python
client.create_search_index('famous', '_yz_default')
```
```erlang
riakc_pb_socket:create_search_index(Pid, <<"famous">>, <<"_yz_default">>, [])
```

The last setup item you need to perform is to *associate a bucket type* with a Solr index. You only need do this once per bucket type. This setting tells Riak Search which bucket values are to be indexed on a write to Riak. For example, to associate a bucket named `cats` with the `famous` index, you can set the bucket property `search_index`.


### Bucket Types

Since Riak 2.0, Basho suggests you [[use bucket types|Using Bucket Types]] to namespace all buckets you create. Bucket types have a lower overhead within the cluster than the default bucket namespace, but require an additional setup step in on commandline.

```bash
riak-admin bucket-type create animals '{"props":{"search_index":"famous"}}'
riak-admin bucket-type activate animals
```

### Security

Security is a new feature of Riak that lets an administrator limit access to certain resources. In the case of search, your options are to limit administration of schemas or indexes (permission `search.admin`) to certain users, and to limit querying (permission `search.query`) to any index or a specific one. The example below shows the various options.

```bash
riak-admin security grant search.admin ON schema TO username
riak-admin security grant search.admin ON index TO username
riak-admin security grant search.query ON index TO username
riak-admin security grant search.query ON index famous TO username
```

## Indexing Values

With a Solr schema, index, and association in place, we're ready to start using Riak Search. First, populate the `cat` bucket with values.

Depending on the driver you use, you may have to specify the `Content-Type`,
which for this example is `application/json`. In the case of Ruby and Python
the content type is automatically set for you based on the object given.

```curl
curl -XPUT "$RIAK_HOST/types/animals/buckets/cats/keys/liono" \
     -H'content-type:application/json' \
     -d'{"name_s":"Lion-o", "age_i":30, "leader_b":true}'

curl -XPUT "$RIAK_HOST/types/animals/buckets/cats/keys/cheetara" \
     -H'content-type:application/json' \
     -d'{"name_s":"Cheetara", "age_i":28, "leader_b":false}'

curl -XPUT "$RIAK_HOST/types/animals/buckets/cats/keys/snarf" \
     -H'content-type:application/json' \
     -d'{"name_s":"Snarf", "age_i":43}'

curl -XPUT "$RIAK_HOST/types/animals/buckets/cats/keys/panthro" \
     -H'content-type:application/json' \
     -d'{"name_s":"Panthro", "age_i":36}'
```
```ruby
bucket = client.bucket("animals", "cats")

cat = bucket.get_or_new("liono")
cat.data = {"name_s" => "Lion-o", "age_i" => 30, "leader_b" => true}
cat.store

cat = bucket.get_or_new("cheetara")
cat.data = {"name_s" => "Cheetara", "age_i" => 28, "leader_b" => false}
cat.store

cat = bucket.get_or_new("snarf")
cat.data = {"name_s" => "Snarf", "age_i" => 43}
cat.store

cat = bucket.get_or_new("panthro")
cat.data = {"name_s" => "Panthro", "age_i" => 36}
cat.store
```
```python
bucket = client.bucket('animals', 'cats')

cat = bucket.new('liono', {'name_s': 'Lion-o', 'age_i': 30, 'leader_b': True})
cat.store()

cat = bucket.new('cheetara', {'name_s':'Cheetara', 'age_i':28, 'leader_b': True})
cat.store()

cat = bucket.new('snarf', {'name_s':'Snarf', 'age_i':43})
cat.store()

cat = bucket.new('panthro', {'name_s':'Panthro', 'age_i':36})
cat.store()
```
```erlang
CO = riakc_obj:new({<<"animals">>, <<"cats">>}, <<"liono">>,
    <<"{\"name_s\":\"Lion-o\", \"age_i\":30, \"leader_b\":true}">>,
    "application/json"),
riakc_pb_socket:put(Pid, CO),

C1 = riakc_obj:new({<<"animals">>, <<"cats">>}, <<"cheetara">>,
    <<"{\"name_s\":\"Cheetara\", \"age_i\":28, \"leader_b\":false}">>,
    "application/json"),
riakc_pb_socket:put(Pid, C1),

C2 = riakc_obj:new({<<"animals">>, <<"cats">>}, <<"snarf">>,
    <<"{\"name_s\":\"Snarf\", \"age_i\":43}">>,
    "application/json"),
riakc_pb_socket:put(Pid, C2),

C3 = riakc_obj:new({<<"animals">>, <<"cats">>}, <<"panthro">>,
    <<"{\"name_s\":\"Panthro\", \"age_i\":36}">>,
    "application/json"),
riakc_pb_socket:put(Pid, C3),
```

If you've used Riak before, you may have noticed that this is no different
than setting values without Riak Search. This is one of the design goals of
Riak Search:

> Write it like Riak. Query it like Solr.

But how does Riak Search know how to index values, given that values are
opaque in Riak? For that, we employ extractors.

### Extractors

*Extractors* are modules in Riak that accept a Riak value with a certain content type, and convert it into a list of fields capable of being indexed by Solr. This is done transparently and automatically as part of the indexing process.

Our current example uses the JSON extractor, but Riak Search also extracts indexable fields from the following content types:

* JSON (`application/json`)
* XML (`application/xml`, `text/xml`)
* Plain text (`text/plain`)
* Datatypes
  * counter (`application/riak_counter`)
  * map (`application/riak_map`)
  * set (`application/riak_set`)
* noop (unknown content type)

In the examples we've seen, the JSON field `name_s` is translated to a Solr index document field insert. Solr will index any field that it recognizes, based on the index's schema. The default schema (`_yz_default`) uses the suffix to decide the field type (`_s` represents a string, `_i` is an integer, `_b` is binary and so on).

If the content type allows for nested values (JSON and XML), the extractors will flatten each field, seperated by dots. For example, if you have this XML:

```xml
<person>
  <pets>
    <pet>
      <name_s>Spot</name_s>
    </pet>
  </pets>
</person>
```

The XML extractor will convert it to the Solr field `person.pets.pet.name_s` with value `Spot`.

Lists of values are assumed to be Solr multi-valued fields.

```json
{"people_ss":["Ryan", "Eric", "Brett"]}
```

The above JSON will insert a list of three values into Solr to be indexed: `people_ss=Ryan`, `people_ss=Eric`, `people_ss=Brett`.

### Automatic Fields

When a Riak object is indexed, Riak Search automatically inserts a few extra fields as well. These are necessary for a variety of technical reasons, and for the most part you don't need to think about them. However, there are a few fields which you may find useful:

- `_yz_rk` (Riak key)
- `_yz_rt` (Riak bucket type)
- `_yz_rb` (Riak bucket)
- `_yz_err` (extraction error)

You can query by these fields, just like any other normal Solr fields. But most of the time you'll use `_yz_rk` as a query result, which tells you the Riak key that matches the query you just ran. Let's see this in detail by running some queries in the next section.

## Querying

After the schema, index, association, population/extraction/indexing has taken place, comes the fun part of querying for data.

### Simple Query

The basic query parameter is `q` via HTTP, or the first parameter of your chosen driver's `search` function. All Distributed Solr queries are supported, which actually includes most of the single-node solr queries. This example is searching for all documents where the `name_s` value begins with *Lion* by means of a glob (wildcard) match.

```curl
curl "$RIAK_HOST/search/famous?wt=json&q=name_s:Lion*" | jsonpp
```
```ruby
results = client.search("famous", "name_s:Lion*")
p results
p results['docs']
```
```python
import pprint
results = bucket.search('name_s:Lion*')
pprint.pprint(results)
pprint.pprint(results['docs'])
```
```erlang
{ok, Results} = riakc_pb_socket:search(Pid, <<"famous">>, <<"name_s:Lion*">>),
io:fwrite("~p~n", [Results]),
Docs = Results#search_results.docs,
io:fwrite("~p~n", [Docs]).
```

The response to a query will be an object containing details about the response, such as a query's max score and a list of documents which match the given query. It's worth noting two things:

- The documents returned are search documents (a set of Solr field/values),
  not a Riak value
- The HTTP response is a direct Solr response, while the drivers use Protocol
  Buffers and are encoded with different field names

This is a common HTTP `response` value:

```json
{
  "numFound": 1,
  "start": 0,
  "maxScore": 1.0,
  "docs": [
    {
      "leader_b": true,
      "age_i": 30,
      "name_s": "Lion-o",
      "_yz_id": "default_cats_liono_37",
      "_yz_rk": "liono",
      "_yz_rt": "default",
      "_yz_rb": "cats"
    }
  ]
}
```

The most important field returned is `docs`, which is the list of objects that each contain fields about matching index documents. The values you'll use most often are `_yz_rt` (Riak bucket type), `_yz_rb` (Riak bucket), `_yz_rk` (Riak key), and `score` which represent the similarity of the matching doc to the query via [Lucene scoring](https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_6_0/core/org/apache/lucene/search/package-summary.html#scoring).

In this example the query fields are returned because they're stored in Solr. This depends on your schema. If they are not stored, you'll have to perform a seperate Riak GET operation to retrieve the value using the `_yz_rk` value.

```curl
curl "$RIAK_HOST/types/animals/buckets/cats/keys/liono"
{"name_s":"Lion-o", "age_i":30, "leader_b":true}
```
```ruby
doc = results["docs"].first
btype = Riak::BucketType.new(client, doc["_yz_rt"]) # animals
bucket = Riak::Bucket.new(client, doc["_yz_rb"])    # cats
object = bucket.get( doc["_yz_rk"] )                # liono
p object.data
# {"name_s" => "Lion-o", "age_i" => 30, "leader_b" => true}
```
```python
doc = results['docs'][0]
bucket = client.bucket(doc['_yz_rt'], doc['_yz_rb']) # animals/cats
object = bucket.get(doc['_yz_rk'])    # liono
pprint.pprint(object.data)
# {"name_s": "Lion-o", "age_i": 30, "leader_b": true}
```
```erlang
[{Index,Doc}|_] = Docs,
BType  = proplists:get_value(<<"_yz_rt">>, Doc),  %% <<"animals">>
Bucket = proplists:get_value(<<"_yz_rb">>, Doc),  %% <<"cats">>
Key    = proplists:get_value(<<"_yz_rk">>, Doc),  %% <<"liono">>
{ok, Obj} = riakc_pb_socket:get(Pid, {BType, Bucket}, Key),
Val = riakc_obj:get_value(Obj),
io:fwrite("~s~n", [Val]).
%% {"name_s":"Lion-o", "age_i":30, "leader_b":true}
```

This was one simple glob query example. There are many query options, a more complete list can be found by digging into [searching solr](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Searching). Let's look at a few others.

#### Range Queries

Searches within a [range](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Standard+Query+Parser#TheStandardQueryParser-DifferencesbetweenLuceneQueryParserandtheSolrStandardQueryParser) of numerical or date/[datemath](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/4_6_0/solr-core/org/apache/solr/util/DateMathParser.html) values.

To find the ages of all famous cats who are 30 or younger: `age_i:[0 TO 30]`. If you wanted to find all cats 30 or older, you could include a glob as a top end of the range: `age_i:[30 TO *]`.

```curl
curl "$RIAK_HOST/search/famous?wt=json&q=age_i:%5B30%20TO%20*%5D" | jsonpp
```
```ruby
client.search("famous", "age_i:[30 TO *]")
```
```python
bucket.search('age_i:[30 TO *]')
```
```erlang
riakc_pb_socket:search(Pid, <<"famous">>, <<"age_i:[30 TO *]">>),
```

<!-- TODO: pubdate:[NOW-1YEAR/DAY TO NOW/DAY+1DAY] -->

#### Boolean

You can perform logical conjunctive, disjunctive, and negative operations on query elements as, repectively, `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`. Let's say we want to see who is capable of being a US Senator (at least 30 years old, and a leader). It requires a conjunctive query: `leader_b:true AND age_i:[25 TO *]`.

```curl
curl "$RIAK_HOST/search/famous?wt=json&q=leader_b:true%20AND%20age_i:%5B25%20TO%20*%5D" | jsonpp
```
```ruby
client.search("famous", "leader_b:true AND age_i:[30 TO *]")
```
```python
bucket.search('leader_b:true AND age_i:[30 TO *]')
```
```erlang
riakc_pb_socket:search(Pid, <<"famous">>, <<"leader_b:true AND age_i:[30 TO *]">>),
```

#### Pagination

A common requirement you may face is paginating searches, where an ordered set of matching documents are returned in non-overlapping sequential subsets (in other words, *pages*). This is easy to do with the `start` and `rows` parameters, where `start` is the number of documents to skip over (the offset) and `rows` are the number of results to return in one go.

For example, assuming we want two results per page, getting the second page is easy, where `start` is calculated as _rows per page * (page number - 1)_.

```curl
ROWS_PER_PAGE=2
PAGE=2
START=$(($ROWS_PER_PAGE * ($PAGE-1)))

curl "$RIAK_HOST/search/famous?wt=json&q=*:*&start=$START&rows=$ROWS_PER_PAGE" | jsonpp
```
```ruby
ROWS_PER_PAGE=2
page = 2
start = ROWS_PER_PAGE * (page - 1)

client.search("famous", "*:*", {:start => start, :rows => ROWS_PER_PAGE})
```
```python
ROWS_PER_PAGE=2
page = 2
start = ROWS_PER_PAGE * (page - 1)

bucket.search('*:*', start=start, rows=ROWS_PER_PAGE)
```
```erlang
-define(ROWS_PER_PAGE, 2).

Page = 2,
Start = ?ROWS_PER_PAGE * (Page - 1),

riakc_pb_socket:search(Pid, <<"famous">>, <<"*:*">>, [{start, Start},{rows, ?ROWS_PER_PAGE}]),
```

### MapReduce

Riak Search allows for piping search results as inputs for MapReduce jobs. This is a useful crossection for performing a post calculations of results, or aggregations of ad-hoc queries. The Riak Search MapReduce integration works similar to regular mapreduce, with the notable exception that your input is not a bucket, but index and query arguments to the `yokozuna` module and `mapred_search` function (an Erlang module:function pair that adds the Riak Search hook to MapReduce).

```json
{
  "inputs":{
    "module":"yokozuna",
    "function":"mapred_search",
    "arg":["famous","NOT leader_b:true"]
  },
  "query":[
    {
      "map":{
        "language":"javascript",
        "keep":false,
        "source":"function(v) { return [1]; }"
      }
    },
    {
      "reduce":{
        "language":"javascript",
        "keep":true,
        "name":"Riak.reduceSum"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example we're searching for all famous cats which are not leaders, and counting up the results using Javascript for both map and reduce. It should return the reduced sum of `[3]`.

```curl
curl -XPOST "$RIAK_HOST/mapred" \
  -H'content-type:application/json' \
  -d '{"inputs":{"module":"yokozuna","function":"mapred_search","arg":["famous","NOT leader_b:true"]},"query":[{"map":{"language":"javascript","keep":false,"source":"function(v) { return [1]; }"}},{"reduce":{"language":"javascript","keep":true,"name":"Riak.reduceSum"}}]}'
```

<!--
#### Functions

Cats age about 7 times faster than humans, so to calculate an age in "cat years", you can multiply the cat's age by 7 using the `product` function. It's only one out of many built-in [Solr Functions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Function+Queries#FunctionQueries-AvailableFunctions).

```curl
curl "$RIAK_HOST/search/famous?wt=json&q=*:*&fl=_yz_rk,age_i:product(age_i,7)" | jsonpp
```
 -->

* Robust, easy-to-use [query languages](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Other+Parsers) like lucene (default) and dismax.
* Queries: exact match, globs, inclusive/exclusive range queries, AND/OR/NOT, prefix matching, proximity searches, term boosting, sorting, pagination
* Protocol Buffer interface and Solr interface via HTTP
* Scoring and ranking for most relevant results
* Query result [highlighting](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Highlighting)
* Search queries as input for MapReduce jobs
