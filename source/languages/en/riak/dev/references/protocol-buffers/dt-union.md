A "union" type for update operations.

## Request

```protobuf
message DtOp {
    optional CounterOp counter_op = 1;
    optional SetOp     set_op     = 2;
    optional MapOp     map_op     = 3;
}
```

The included operation depends on the Data Type that is being updated. `DtOp` messages are sent only as part of a `[[DtUpdateReq|PBC Data Type Store]]` message.
