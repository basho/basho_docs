Reports about the performance and configuration of the Riak node to which it was requested. You must have the `{riak_kv_stat,true}` configuration setting in app.config for this endpoint to be active. This is equivalent to the [[riak-admin status|Command-Line Tools#status]] command.

## Request

```bash
GET /stats
```

Important headers:

* `Accept` - determines whether the response will be formatted in `application/json` or `text/plain`.

## Response

Normal status codes:
* `200 OK`

Typical error codes:
* `404 Not Found` - if `riak_kv_stat` is not enabled

Important headers:
* `Content-Type` - `application/json` or `text/plain` (JSON with added line-breaks)

## Example

```curl
$ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8098/stats -H "Accept: text/plain"
* About to connect() to 127.0.0.1 port 8098 (#0)
*   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected

## Output Explanation

The output of `/stats` contains a number of configuration and performance details. An explanation of these details follows.
