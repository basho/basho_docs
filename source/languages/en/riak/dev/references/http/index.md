Riak has a rich, full-featured HTTP 1.1 API.  This is an overview of the
operations you can perform via HTTP and can be used as a guide for developing a
compliant client.  All URLs assume the default configuration values where
applicable. All examples use `curl` to interact with Riak.

<div class="note"><div class="title">URL Escaping</div>
<p>Buckets, keys, and link specifications may not contain unescaped slashes. Use
a URL-escaping library or replace slashes with `%2F`.</p>
</div>

## Bucket Operations

Buckets in Riak are a virtual concept. They exist primarily as a namespace
mechanism and as a mechanism to isolate specific behavior changes that deviate
from the default bucket settings. For example, you may augment the [[number of
replicas|Replication#Selecting-an-N-value-(n_val)]], the specific storage
backend and [[commit hooks|Using Commit Hooks]] at the bucket level.

<div class="info"><div class="title">How Many Buckets Can I Have?</div>
<p>Currently, buckets come with virtually no cost except for when you modify the
default bucket properties. Modified Bucket properties are gossiped around the
cluster and therefore add to the amount of data sent around the network. In
other words, buckets using the default bucket properties are free.</p>
</div>

<div class="note"><div class="title">Delete Buckets</div>
<p>There is no straightforward way to delete an entire Bucket. To delete all
the keys in a bucket, you'll need to delete them all individually.</P>
