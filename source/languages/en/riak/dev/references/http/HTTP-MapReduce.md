[[MapReduce]] is a generic way to query Riak by specifying inputs and constructing a set of map, reduce, and link phases through which data will flow.

## Request

```bash
POST /mapred
```

Important headers:
* `Content-Type` - must always be `application/json`.  The format of the request body is described in detail on the [[MapReduce]] page.

Optional query parameters:
* `chunked` - when set to `true`, results will be returned as they are received in `multipart/mixed` format using chunked-encoding.

_+This request must include an entity (body), which is the JSON form of the MapReduce query.+_

## Response

Normal status codes:
* `200 OK`

Typical error codes:
* `400 Bad Request` - if an invalid job is submitted.
* `500 Internal Server Error` - if there was an error in processing a map or reduce function
* `503 Service Unavailable` - if the job timed out before it could complete

Important headers:
* `Content-Type` - `application/json` when `chunked` is not true, otherwise `multipart/mixed` with `application/json` sections.
