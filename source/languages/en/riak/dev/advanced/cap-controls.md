Here, we are going to talk about how Riak distributes your data around the cluster and lets you tune your levels of consistency and availability. This has immense value and implications for your applications, and it's one of the Riak features that we feel truly differentiates us.

At the bottom of this page there is a final screencast that briefly touches on how to adjust your replication levels to match your application and business needs. Before you watch that, however, have a quick read of the content below.

## A Primer on N, R, and W

Riak exposes "CAP Controls" to the developers in such a way that they can, down to the Bucket level, tune how many copies of data we want to store. We do this using N, R, and W values.

Riak's guiding design principle is Dr. Eric Brewer's CAP Theorem. The CAP theorem defines distributed systems in terms of three desired properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition (failure) tolerance. The theorem states you can only rely on having two of the three properties at any time.

Riak chooses to focus on the A and P of CAP. The choice puts Riak in the eventually consistent camp. However, the window for "eventually consistent" is in terms of milliseconds which can be good enough for many applications.

### N Value and Replication

All data stored in Riak will be replicated to a number of nodes in the cluster according to the N value (n_val) property set on the bucket. By default, Riak chooses an n_val of "3" for you. This means that data stored in the bucket will be replicated to three different nodes, thus storing three copies. For this to be effective, you need at least three physical nodes in your cluster. (We can, however, demonstrate its merits with local nodes.)

To change the N value for a bucket (to something different than the default) issue a PUT request to the bucket with the new N value. If you still have your three node Riak cluster running, try this:

```
$ curl -v -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/another_bucket \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"props":{"n_val":2}}'
```

This will change the n_val of the bucket "another_bucket" to two, meaning that each piece of data in that bucket will be replicated to two partitions in the cluster.

<div class="note"><div class="title">A Word on Setting the N Value</div><code>n_val</code> must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the number of actual nodes in your cluster to get all the benefits of replication. And, we advise against modifying the n_val of a bucket after its initial creation as this may result in failed reads because the new value may not be replicated to all the appropriate partitions.</div>

### R Value and Read Failure Tolerance

So we changed the Bucket n_val to 2 with that last command.

Riak allows the client to supply an "R value" on each direct fetch. The R value represents the number of Riak nodes which must return results for a read before the read is considered successful. This allows Riak to provide read availability even when nodes are down or laggy.

For example, in this HTTP request, the r value is set to 1:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/images/1.png?r=1
```

This means that Riak will return a copy of that data if at least 1 copy is present in your cluster.

### W Value and Write Fault Tolerance

Riak also allows the client to supply a "W value" on each update. The W value represents the number of Riak nodes which must report success before an update is considered complete. This allows Riak to provide write availability even when nodes are down or laggy.

In this PUT operation, you can see the w value set to 3.

```
$ curl -v -XPUT http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/docs/story.txt?w=3 \
  -H "Content-type: text/plain" \
  --data-binary @story.txt
```

### Symbolic Consistency Names

Riak 0.12 introduced "symbolic" consistency options for R and W that can be easier to use and understand. They are:

* *all* - All replicas must reply. This is the same as setting R or W equal to N.
* *one* - This is the same as sending 1 as the R or W value.
* *quorum* - A majority of the replicas must respond, that is, "half plus one". For the default N value of 3, this calculates to 2.
* *default* - Uses whatever the per-bucket consistency property is for R or W, which may be any of the above values, or an integer.

Not submitting an R or W value is the same as sending "default".

## N, R and W in Action

Here is brief screencast that will show you just how the N, R, and W values function in our running three node Riak cluster:
