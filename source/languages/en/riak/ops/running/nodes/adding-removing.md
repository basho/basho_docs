This page describes the process of adding and removing nodes to and from
a Riak cluster. We'll look at how you join nodes together into a
cluster, and what happens when you add or remove nodes.

Preconditions
-------------

For most operations you need to access configuration files, whose
location depends on your mode of installation and the operating system.
Check the [[Configuration Files]] page for details on where to find them.

Creating the First Node
-----------------------

After installing Riak on a system using either the binary packages or
from source, there's some initial configuration steps you need to take
that depend on your networking infrastructure and security measures.

Your node should not be running. If it is, stop it using the [[`riak stop` command|Command Line Tools - riak#stop]] or `/etc/init.d/riak stop`). Before you can start up the node
again, a couple of changes need to made. If your new node was already
running before making the configuration changes outlined below, it's
best to delete your ring directory before starting it up again. Just
delete the directory ring/ in your Riak data directory. In general, the
steps outlined below should be taken before you bring up a new node.

Change the Node Name
--------------------

The node name is an important setting for the Erlang VM, especially when
you want to build a cluster of nodes, as the node name identifies both
the Erlang application and the host name on the network. All nodes in
the Riak cluster need these node names to communicate and coordinate
with each other.

The node name is configured in `vm.args`. Change the following line,
which defaults to 127.0.0.1 (a.k.a. localhost):

```erlang
-name riak@127.0.0.1
```

Change it to something that corresponds to either the IP address or a
resolvable host name for this particular node, like so:

```erlang
-name riak@192.168.1.10
```

Change the HTTP and Protocol Buffers binding address
----------------------------------------------------

By default, Riak's HTTP and Protocol Buffers services are bound to the
local interface, i.e. 127.0.0.1, and are therefore unable to serve
requests from the outside network. The relevant setting is configured in
[[`app.config`|Configuration Files#app.config]],
under the riak\_core section that reads:

```erlang
{http, [ {"127.0.0.1", 8098 } ]},
```

Either change it to use an IP address that corresponds to one of the
server's network interfaces, or 0.0.0.0 to allow access from all
interfaces and networks, e.g.:

```erlang
{http, [ {"0.0.0.0", 8098 } ]},
```

The same configuration should be changed for the Protocol Buffers
interface if you intend on using it. Do the same as above for the line
in the `riak_kv` section that reads:

```erlang
{pb_ip,   "127.0.0.1" },
```

Start the Node
--------------

Just like initial the configuration steps, this step has to be repeated
for every node in your cluster. Before a node can join an existing
cluster it needs to be started. Depending on your mode of installation,
use either the init scripts installed by the Riak binary packages or
simply the script `riak`:

```bash
/etc/init.d/riak start
```

or

```bash
bin/riak start
```

What Happens When You Start a Node?
-----------------------------------

When you start a node it looks for a cluster description, known as the
"ring file", in its data directory. If one does not exist it creates a
new ring description based on the initially configured
`ring_creation_size`, claiming all partitions for itself. The node is
then ready to serve requests.

Add a Node to an Existing Cluster
---------------------------------

When the node is running, it can be added to an existing cluster. (Note
that this step isn't necessary for the first node but only the ones you
want to add after.) Pick a random node in your existing cluster and use the `riak-admin cluster join` command to stage
a join request from the new node. The example shown below uses the IP
192.168.2.2 as the so-called "seed node", the node that seeds the
existing cluster data to the new node.

```bash
riak-admin cluster join riak@192.168.2.2
```

This should result in a message similar to the following:

```
Success: staged join request for 'riak@192.168.2.5' to 'riak@192.168.2.2'
```

Repeat this process on each new node that will joined to form the cluster.

Joining Nodes to Form a Cluster
-------------------------------

The process of joining a cluster involves several steps, including staging the proposed cluster nodes, reviewing the cluster plan, and committing the changes.

After staging each of the cluster nodes with `riak-admin cluster join` commands, the next step in forming a cluster is to review the proposed plan of changes. This can be done with the `riak-admin cluster plan` command, which is shown in the example below.

```
=============================== Staged Changes ================================
Action         Nodes(s)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
join           'riak@192.168.2.2'
join           'riak@192.168.2.2'
join           'riak@192.168.2.2'
join           'riak@192.168.2.2'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE: Applying these changes will result in 1 cluster transition

```

If the plan is to your liking, submit the changes by typing `riak-admin cluster commit`.

The Node Join Process
---------------------

When a join request is sent from a new node, it will ask the seed node to send its
cluster state. When the new node receives the cluster state, it discards
its own, overwriting it completely with the state it just received. It
then starts claiming partitions until the number of partitions in the
cluster reaches an even distribution (or close thereto), taking into
account the N value to guarantee an optimal physical distribution of
partitions in the cluster.

While claiming partitions, the new node keeps updating the cluster state
until an even distribution is reached. Claiming a partition means that
the new node is now a primary replica for the particular partition.

When the node has recalculated a new cluster state, it gossips the state
to a random node in the cluster, thus making its own claims known to the
other nodes.

After it ensured that all the vnodes it's responsible for are running
(vnodes are mapped to Erlang processes), partition handoff will start,
transferring data from existing nodes to the new one. The handoff is
initiated by the existing nodes after they received the new cluster
state, as the vnodes running on them realize that they're not a primary
replica for a particular partition anymore, therefore transferring all
their data to the new primary replica on the node that just joined.

This process happens asynchronously as the gossip is updated across the
cluster over the next couple of minutes. Remember that after claiming
its partitions the new node only gossips the new cluster state to a
random node in the cluster, which then in turn gossips the state to the
other nodes, so it can take up to a minute until the handoff starts.

During the handoff, the new cluster state is already known throughout
the cluster, so there are periods where handoff is still active, but the
new node is already expected to serve requests. Basho is working on
improving this situation, but in general the application interacting
with Riak is expected to deal with situations where not all replicas may
have the data yet. See our page on [[Eventual Consistency]]
for more details on these scenarios.

introduction|https://github.com/rzezeski/try-try-try/tree/master/2011/riak-core-the-vnode]]
of what happens during a vnode's lifecycle, including an overview of the
different states of handoff.</div>


Removing a Node From a Cluster
------------------------------

A node can be removed from the cluster in two ways. One assumes that a
node is decommissioned, for example because its added capacity is not
needed anymore or because it's explicitly replaced with a new one. The
second is relevant for failure scenarios, where a node has crashed and
is irrecoverable, so it must be removed from the cluster from another
node.

The command to remove a running node is `riak-admin cluster leave`. This command
must be executed on the node that's supposed to be removed from the
cluster.

Similarly to joining a node, after executing `riak-admin cluster leave`, the cluster plan must be reviewed with `riak-admin cluster plan`, and the changes committed with `riak-admin cluster commit`.

Learn more about the new [[cluster command|Command-Line Tools - riak-admin#cluster]] introduced in Riak version 1.2.

</div>

The other command is `riak-admin cluster leave <node>`, where `<node>` is an
Erlang node name as specified in the node's vm.args file, e.g.

```bash
riak-admin cluster leave riak@192.168.2.1
```

This command can be run from any other node in the cluster.

Under the hood, both commands basically do the same thing. Running
`riak-admin cluster leave <node>` just selects the current node for you automatically.

As with `riak-admin cluster leave`, the plan to have a node leave the cluster must be first reviewed with `riak-admin cluster plan`, and committed with `riak-admin cluster commit` before any changes will actually take place.

What Happens When You Remove a Node?
------------------------------------

Removing a node is basically the process of joining a node in reverse.
Instead of claiming partitions, the node to be removed determines a new
cluster state, taking out all the partitions it currently owns,
re-distributing them evenly across the remaining nodes.

The new state is sent to all nodes in the cluster, not just a random
one, so every node in the cluster immediately knows that the node left.
Then it sets the cluster state on the leaving node, causing hand-off to
start, which again is initialized by vnodes realizing they're not the
primary replicas anymore, transferring the data to the new owners.

When all data is handed off, the Erlang VM process eventually exits.

In case you're using `riak-admin remove` on a different node, this whole
process will occur on that particular node instead. The last step,
forcing the old node to hand-off data, will obviously fail in a scenario
where the node to be removed is not available anymore, but the cluster,
given enough replicas, will balance itself out even without the failed
node.
