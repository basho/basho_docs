In the event of major hardware or filesystem problems, LevelDB can become corrupted. These failures are uncommon, but they could happen, as heavy loads can push I/O limits.

## Checking for Compaction Errors

Any time there is a compaction error, it will be noted in the LevelDB logs. Those logs are located in a `LOG` file in each instance of LevelDB in a Riak node, specifically in `#(platform_data_dir)/leveldb/<vnode>/LOG`. The `platform_data_dir` can be specified in the `[[riak.conf|Configuration Files]]` configuration file. The default is `./data`.

Compaction error messages take the following form:

```
<timestamp> Compaction Error: Corruption: corrupted compressed block contents
```

To check whether your node has experienced such errors, you will need to run a script that searches for `Compaction Error` in each `LOG` file. Here is an example script:

```bash
find . -name "LOG" -exec grep -l 'Compaction error' {} \;
```

If there are compaction errors in any of your vnodes, those will be listed in the console. If a vnodes has experienced such errors, you would see output like this:

```
./442446784738847563128068650529343492278651453440/LOG 
```

While corruption on one vnode is not uncommon, corruption in several vnodes very likely means that there is a deeper problem that needs to be address, perhaps on the OS or hardware level.

## Healing Corrupted LevelDBs

{{#1.3.0-}}
<div class="note">
<div class="title">Warning</div>
There is a known issue in Riak 1.2.x where running a LevelDB repair will bring down a machine and affect the whole cluster as a result.  Please contact Basho support before running a LevelDB repair on any Riak 1.2.x nodes.
</div>
{{/1.3.0-}}

The first step in properly addressing this problem is to stop the node.

```bash
riak stop
```

Repairing the corrupted LevelDB can be done through the [Erlang shell](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/starting-out). Do not start Riak at this point; use the shell only.

You can fire up the shell by running the `erl` command. To ensure that you start up the shell using the same version of Erlang that's embedded with Riak, you should run the `erl` command as an absolute path. Here's an example:

```bash
/opt/local/riak/erts-5.8.5/bin/erl
```

Once you're in the shell, run the following command:

```erlang
[application:set_env(eleveldb, Var, Val) || {Var, Val} <- 
    [{max_open_files, 2000}, 
     {block_size, 1048576}, 
     {cache_size, 20*1024*1024*1024}, 
     {sync, false}, 
     {data_root, ""}]].
```

For each corrupted LevelDB that you found using the `find` command (as demonstrated above), run the following `repair` command, substituting the path to your LevelDB vnodes and the appropriate vnode number:

```erlang
eleveldb:repair("/path-to-vnode/<vnode_number>", []).
```

This process will likely take several minutes. When it has completed successfully, you can restart the node and continue as usual.

```bash
riak start
```
