This document covers the parameters that are commonly adjusted when 
setting up a new cluster. We recommand that you also review the
detailed [[Configuration Files]] document before moving a cluster into
production.

All configuration values discussed here are managed via the
configuration file on each node, and a node must be restarted for any
changes to take effect.

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Note</div>
If you are upgrading to Riak version 2.0 or later from an pre-2.0 release, you can use either your old <code>app.config</code> configuration file or the newer <code>riak.conf</code> if you wish.
 
If you have installed Riak 2.0 directly, you should use only <code>riak.conf</code>.
 
More on configuring Riak can be found in the [[configuration files]] doc.
</div>

We advise that you make as many of the changes below as practical
_before_ joining the nodes together into a cluster. Once your configuration
has been set on each node, follow the steps in [[Basic Cluster Setup]] to
complete the clustering process.

Use `[[riak-admin member-status|riak-admin Command Line#member-status]]`
to determine whether any given node is a member of a cluster.

## Ring Size

The ring size, in Riak parlance, is the number of data partitions that
comprise the cluster. This quantity impacts the scalability and
performance of a cluster and, importantly, **it should established
before the cluster starts receiving data**.

In versions of Riak greater than 2.0, there is a [[ring resizing]] feature
that enables you to change the ring size in a cluster on a node-by-node
basis while the cluster is running, but we recommend using this feature
only when necessary. Getting the ring size right from the beginning is
the preferred approach.

If the ring size is too large for the number of servers, disk I/O will
be negatively impacted by the excessive number of concurrent databases
running on each server; if the ring size is too small, the servers' other
resources (primarily CPU and RAM) will go underutilized.

See [[Planning for a Riak System]] and [[Scaling and Operating Riak
Best Practices]] for more details on choosing a ring size.

The steps involved in changing the ring size depend on whether the
servers (nodes) in the cluster have already been joined together.

### Cluster already in active use

If you have a cluster in use and need to preserve its data while
resizing the ring, you may perform a rolling [[ring resize|Ring Resizing]] on
each node in your cluster.

### Cluster joined, but no data needs to be preserved

1.  Change the ring creation size parameter by uncommenting it and then setting it to the desired value, for example 64:

    ```riakconf
    ring_size = 64
    ```

    ```appconfig
    %% In the riak_core section:
    {ring_creation_size, 64}
    ```

2.  Stop all nodes
3.  Remove the ring data file on each node (see [[Backing up Riak]] for the location of this file)
4.  Start all nodes
5.  Re-add each node to the cluster (see [[Adding and Removing Nodes|Adding and Removing Nodes#Add-a-Node-to-an-Existing-Cluster]]) or finish reviewing this document and proceed to [[Basic Cluster Setup]]

### New servers, have not yet joined a cluster

1.  Change the ring creation size parameter by uncommenting it and then setting it to the desired value, for example 64:

    ```riakconf
    ring_size = 64
    ```

    ```appconfig
    %% In the riak_core section:
    {ring_creation_size, 64}
    ```

2.  Stop all nodes
3.  Remove the ring data file on each node (see [[Backing up Riak]] for the location of this file)
4.  Finish reviewing this document and proceed to [[Basic Cluster Setup]]

### Verifying ring size

You can use the `riak-admin` command can verify the ring size:

```bash
riak-admin status | grep ring
```

Console output:

```
ring_members : ['riak@10.160.13.252']
ring_num_partitions : 8
ring_ownership : <<"[{'riak@10.160.13.252',8}]">>
ring_creation_size : 8
```

If `ring_num_partitions` and `ring_creation_size` do not agree, that
means that the `ring_creation_size` value was changed too late and that
the proper steps were not taken to start over with a new ring.

**Note**: Riak will not allow two nodes with different ring sizes to
be joined into a cluster.

## Backend

Another critical decision to be made is the backend to use. The
choice of backend strongly influences the performance characteristics
and feature set for a Riak environment.

See [[Choosing a Backend]] for a list of supported backends. Each
referenced document includes the necessary configuration bits.

As with ring size, changing the backend will result in all data being
effectively lost, so spend the necessary time up front to evaluate and
benchmark backends.

If still in doubt, consider using the [[Multi]] backend for future
flexibility.

If you do change backends from the default ([[Bitcask]]), make sure
you change it across all nodes. It is possible but generally unwise to
use different backends on different nodes, as this would limit the
effectiveness of backend-specific features.

## Default Bucket Properties

Bucket properties are also very important factors in Riak's performance and
general behavior. The properties for any individual bucket can be configured dynamically [[using bucket types]], but default values for those properties can be defined in your [[configuration files|Configuration Files]].

Below is an example of setting `last_write_wins` to `true` and `r` to 3.

```riakconf
buckets.default.last_write_wins = true
buckets.default.r = 3
```

```appconfig
{default_bucket_props, [
    {last_write_wins,true},
    {r,3},
    ...
    ]}
```

For more on bucket properties, we recommend reviewing our docs on [[buckets]], [[bucket types|Using Bucket Types]], [[replication properties]], and [[eventual consistency]], as well as Basho's five-part blog series, "Understanding Riak's Configurable Behaviors."

* [[Part 1|http://basho.com/understanding-riaks-configurable-behaviors-part-1/]]
* [[Part 2|http://basho.com/riaks-config-behaviors-part-2/]]
* [[Part 3|http://basho.com/riaks-config-behaviors-part-3/]]
* [[Part 4|http://basho.com/riaks-config-behaviors-part-4/]]
* [[Epilogue|http://basho.com/riaks-config-behaviors-epilogue/]]

If the default bucket properties are modified in your configuration files
and the node is restarted, any existing buckets will **not** be directly
impacted, although the mechanism described in [[HTTP Reset Bucket Properties]] can be used to force them to pick up the new defaults.

## System tuning

Please review the following documents before conducting any
[[benchmarking|Basho Bench]] and/or rolling out a live production
cluster.

* [[Open Files Limit]]
* [[Linux Performance Tuning]]
* [[AWS Performance Tuning]]
* [[Configuration Files]]

## Joining the nodes together

Please see [[Basic Cluster Setup]] for the cluster creation process.
