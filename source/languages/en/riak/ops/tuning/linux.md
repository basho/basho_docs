Many Unix-like operating systems and distributions are tuned for desktop or
light use out of the box and not for a production database. This guide
describes recommended system performance tunings for operators of new and
existing Riak clusters. The tunings present in this guide should be considered
as a starting point. It is important to make note of what changes are made and
when in order to measure the impact of those changes.

For performance and tuning recommendations specific to running Riak clusters on
the Amazon Web Services EC2 environment, see [[AWS Performance Tuning]].

<div class="note">

Unless otherwise specified, the tunings recommended below are for Linux
distributions. Users implementing Riak on BSD and Solaris distributions can use
these tuning recommendations to make analogous changes in those operating
systems.

## Storage and File System Tuning

### Virtual Memory

Due to the heavily I/O-focused profile of Riak, swap usage can result in the
entire server becoming unresponsive. We recommend setting `vm.swappiness` to 0
in `/etc/sysctl.conf` to prevent swapping as much as possible:

```config
vm.swappiness = 0
```

Ideally, you should disable swap to ensure that Riak's process pages are not
swapped. Disabling swap will allow Riak to crash in situations where it runs out
 of memory. This will leave a crash dump file, named `rel_crash.dump`, in the
 `/var/log/riak` directory which can be used to determine the cause of the
 memory usage.

In addition to swappiness, the below virtual memory settings help prevent disks
from being overwhelmed during periods of high write activity at the expense of
peak performance for spiky workloads, and can be added or updated in 
`/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```config
vm.dirty_bytes = 209715200
vm.dirty_background_bytes = 104857600
```

### Mounts

Riak makes heavy use of disk I/O for its storage operations. It is important
that you mount volumes that Riak will be using for data storage with the
`noatime` flag, meaning that filesystem
[inodes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode) on the volume will not be touched
when read. This flag can be set temporarily using the following command:


```bash
mount -o remount,noatime <riak_data_volume>
```

Replace `<riak_data_volume>` in the above example with your actual Riak data
volume. The `noatime` can be set in `/etc/fstab` to mount permanently.

### Schedulers

I/O or disk scheduling is a blanket term used to describe the method by which an
 operating system chooses how to order input and output operations to and from
 storage.

The default I/O scheduler (elevator) on Linux is completely fair queuing or
`cfq`, which is designed for desktop use. While a good general-purpose
scheduler, is not designed to provide the kind of throughput expected in
production database deployments.

Scheduler recommendations:

* The `noop` scheduler when deploying on iSCSI over HBAs, or any hardware-based
  RAID.
* The `deadline` scheduler when using SSD-based storage.

To check the scheduler in use for block device `sda`, for example, use the
following command:

```bash
cat /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
```

To set the scheduler to `deadline`, use the following command:

```bash
echo deadline > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
```

The default I/O scheduler queue size is 128. The scheduler queue sorts writes in
 an attempt to optimize for sequential I/O and reduce seek time. Changing the
 depth of the scheduler queue to 1024 can increase the proportion of sequential
 I/O that disks perform and improve overall throughput.

To check the scheduler depth for block device `sda`, use the following command:

```bash
cat /sys/block/sda/queue/nr_requests
```

To increase the scheduler depth to 1024, use the following command:

```bash
echo 1024 > /sys/block/sda/queue/nr_requests
```

### Filesystem

Advanced journaling filesystems like [ZFS](http://zfsonlinux.org/) and
[XFS](http://xfs.org/index.php/Main_Page) are recommended for greater
reliability and recoverability.

At this time, Basho can recommend using ZFS on Solaris, SmartOS, and OmniOS. ZFS
may work well with Riak on direct Solaris clones like IllumOS, but we cannot
yet recommend this. ZFS on Linux is still too early in its project lifetime to
be recommendable for production use due to concerns that have been raised about
excessive memory use. ZFS on FreeBSD is more mature than ZFS on Linux, but Basho
has not yet performed sufficient performance and reliability testing to
recommend using ZFS and Riak on FreeBSD.

In the meantime, the [ext3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3) and
[ext4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4) filesystems are sufficient on
operating systems on which ZFS or XFS are not available or recommended.

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Note</div>
Production use of the <a href="http://zfsonlinux.org/">ZFS On Linux</a> project
is currently <strong>NOT</strong> recommended.
</div>

The ext4 file system defaults include two options that increase integrity but
slow performance. Because Riak's integrity is based on multiple nodes holding
the same data, these two options can be changed to boost I/O performance. We
recommend setting `barrier=0` and `data=writeback` when using the ext4
filesystem.

Similarly, the XFS file system defaults can be optimized to improve performance.
We recommend setting `nobarrier`, `logbufs=8`, `logbsize=256k`, and
`allocsize=2M` when using the XFS filesystem.

As with the `noatime` setting, these settings should be added to `/etc/fstab`
so that they are persisted across server restarts.

## Kernel and Network Tuning

The following settings are minimally sufficient to improve many aspects of Riak
usage on Linux, and should be added or updated in `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Note</div>
In general, these recommended values should be compared with the system defaults
and only changed if benchmarks or other performance metrics indicate that
networking is the bottleneck.
</div>

```config
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 40000
net.core.somaxconn=40000
net.ipv4.tcp_sack = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 15
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl = 30
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_moderate_rcvbuf = 1
```

The following settings are optional, but may improve performance on
a 10Gb network:

```config
net.core.rmem_max = 134217728
net.core.wmem_max = 134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_mem  = 134217728 134217728 134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 277750 134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 277750 134217728
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 300000
```

Certain network interfaces ship with on-board features that have been shown to
hinder Riak network performance. These features can be disabled via `ethtool`.

For an Intel chipset NIC using the "ixgbe" driver running as `eth0`, for
example, run the following command:

```bash
ethtool -K eth0 lro off
```

For a Broadcom chipset NIC using the `bnx` or `bnx2` driver, run:

```bash
ethtool -K eth0 tso off
```

`ethtool` settings can be persisted across reboots by adding the above command
to the `/etc/rc.local` script.

<div class="info">
<div class="title">Tip</div>
Tuning these values will be required if they are changed, as they affect all
network operations.

## Open Files Limit

Riak and supporting tools can consume a large number of open file handles
during normal operation. For stability, increasing the number of open files
limit is necessary. See [[Open Files Limit]] for more details.
