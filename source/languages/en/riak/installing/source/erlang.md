## kerl Prerequisites

[kerl](https://github.com/yrashk/kerl) is the quickest way to install different versions of Erlang on most systems.

Install kerl by running the following command:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spawngrid/kerl/master/kerl
chmod a+x kerl
```

If you are using Mac OS X, FreeBSD, or Solaris, see the following sections for additional requirements before building with kerl.

Otherwise, continue with [[Installing with kerl|Installing Erlang#Installing-with-kerl]].

### Configuring kerl on FreeBSD/Solaris

Start by by creating a `~/.kerlrc` file:

```bash
touch ~/.kerlrc
```

Next add the following contents to your `~/.kerlrc` file:

```shell
KERL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="--disable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads
                        --enable-kernel-poll --without-odbc --enable-darwin-64bit"
```

Then check for the presence of autoconf by running:

```shell
which autoconf
```
If this returns `autoconf not found`, install autoconf by running:

```shell
sudo pkg update
sudo pkg install autoconf
```

Once you've configured kerl and installed autoconf continue with [[Installing with kerl|Installing Erlang#Installing-with-kerl]].


### Configuring kerl on Mac OS X

To compile Erlang as 64-bit on Mac OS X you need to instruct kerl to pass the correct flags to the `configure` command.

Start by by creating a `~/.kerlrc` file:

```bash
touch ~/.kerlrc
```

Next add the following contents to your `~/.kerlrc` file:

```shell
KERL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="--disable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads
                        --enable-kernel-poll --without-odbc --enable-darwin-64bit"
```

On OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later, you may need to install [autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/).

Check for the presence of autoconf by running:

```shell
which autoconf
```

If this returns `autoconf not found`, install autoconf with:

With Homebrew:

```shell
brew install autoconf
```

Or with curl:

```shell
curl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.69.tar.gz
tar zxvf autoconf-2.69.tar.gz
cd autoconf-2.69
./configure && make && sudo make install
```

Once you've configured kerl and installed autoconf continue with [[Installing with kerl|Installing Erlang#Installing-with-kerl]].

## Installing with kerl

First make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies and prerequisites found in [[kerl Prerequisites|Installing Erlang#kerl-Prerequisites]].

With [kerl](https://github.com/yrashk/kerl)  installed, you can install Basho's recommended version of
Erlang [from Github](https://github.com/basho/otp) using the following
command:

```bash
./kerl build git git://github.com/basho/otp.git OTP_R16B02_basho8 R16B02-basho8
```

This builds the Erlang distribution and performs all of the steps
required to manually install Erlang for you.

After Erlang is successfully built, you can install the build as follows:

```bash
./kerl install R16B02-basho8 ~/erlang/R16B02-basho8
. ~/erlang/R16B02-basho8/activate
```

The last line activates the Erlang build that was just installed into
`~/erlang/R16B02-basho8`.

> See the kerl [README](https://github.com/yrashk/kerl) for more details on the available commands.

Confirm Erlang installed to the correct location:

```bash
which erl

```

Follow the steps below to configure Erlang for your operating system.

#### Configuring Erlang on Mavericks (OS X 10.9), Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8), and Lion (OS X 10.7)

If you're on Mavericks (OS X 10.9), Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8), or Lion
(OS X 10.7) you can use LLVM (the default) or GCC to compile Erlang.

Using LLVM:

```bash
CFLAGS=-O0 ./configure --disable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads \
--enable-kernel-poll --enable-darwin-64bit
```

Or if you prefer GCC:

```bash
CC=gcc-4.2 CPPFLAGS='-DNDEBUG' MAKEFLAGS='-j 3' \
./configure --disable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads \
--enable-kernel-poll --enable-darwin-64bit
```

#### Configuring Erlang on Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6)

If you're on Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) or Leopard (OS X 10.5) with an
Intel processor:

```bash
./configure --disable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads \
--enable-kernel-poll  --enable-darwin-64bit
```

#### Configuring Erlang on older versions of OS X

If you're on a non-Intel processor or older version of OS X:

```bash
./configure --disable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads \
--enable-kernel-poll
```

After you've configured your system `cd` into the unpacked directory, build and install Erlang with:

```bash
cd OTP_R16B02_basho8
./otp_build autoconf
./configure && make && sudo make install
```

Confirm Erlang installed to the correct location by running:

```bash
which erl
```

And start Erlang from your terminal with:

```bash
erl
```

## Installing on Mac OS X with Homebrew

To install Erlang with Homebrew, use this command:

```bash
brew install erlang
```

Confirm Erlang installed to the correct location by running:

```bash
which erl
```

And start Erlang from your terminal with:

```bash
erl
```

## Installing on Mac OS X with MacPorts

Installing with MacPorts:

```bash
port install erlang +ssl
```

Confirm Erlang installed to the correct location by running:

```bash
which erl
```

And start Erlang from your terminal with:

```bash
erl
```

## Installing on RHEL/CentOS

First make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies and prerequisites found in [[RHEL/CentOS Prerequisites|Installing Erlang#RHEL-CentOS-Prerequisites]].

Using `wget`:

```bash
wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.basho.com/erlang/otp_src_R16B02-basho8.tar.gz
```

Then unpack the download with:

```bash
tar zxvf otp_src_R16B02-basho8.tar.gz
```

Next `cd` into the unpacked directory, build and install Erlang with:

```bash
cd OTP_R16B02_basho8
./otp_build autoconf
./configure && make && sudo make install
```

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Note for RHEL6/CentOS6</div>
In certain versions of RHEL6 and CentO6 the `openSSL-devel` package
ships with Elliptical Curve Cryptography partially disabled. To
communicate this to Erlang and prevent compile- and run-time errors, the
environment variable `CFLAGS="-DOPENSSL_NO_EC=1"` needs to be added to
Erlang's `./configure` call.

The full `make` invocation then becomes

```bash
CFLAGS="-DOPENSSL_NO_EC=1" ./configure && make && sudo make install
```
</div>

Confirm Erlang installed to the correct location:

```bash
which erl
```

And start Erlang from your terminal with:

```bash
erl
```
