## Overview

  This document is a guide to developing extensions for Riak EE Replication.

### Replication Hooks

   Riak replication allows applications to register replication hooks to control
   when extra objects need to be replicated along with the current object, or
   when an object should not be replicated.

   To register a hook, you must call:

```
riak_core:register([{repl_helper, MyMod}]).
```

### Implementing a Sample Replication Hook

The following is a simple replication hook that will log whenever an object is received via replication.  For more information about the functions in the sample, see the [Replication Hook API](#ReplicationHookApi) section below.

Here is the relevant Erlang code.

```erlang
%% Riak Enterprise MDC replication hook sample
 
-module(riak_repl_hook_sample).
-export([register/0]).
-export([recv/1, send/2, send_realtime/2]).
 
register() ->
	riak_core:wait_for_service(riak_repl),
	lager:log(info,self(),"Automatically registering ~p hook with riak_core",[?MODULE_STRING]),
	riak_core:register([{repl_helper, ?MODULE}]),
	case lists:member({undefined,?MODULE}, app_helper:get_env(riak_core,repl_helper, [])) of
		true ->
			lager:log(info,self(),"Successfully registered ~p hook with riak_core",[?MODULE_STRING]);
		false ->
			lager:log(info,self(),"Failed to register ~p hook with riak_core",[?MODULE_STRING])
	end,
	ok.
 
recv(Object) ->
	% This is a BLOCKING function.
	% Longer running processes should be handled asynchronously.
	lager:log(info,self(),"Called recv(~p)",[riak_object:key(Object)]),
	ok.
	
send_realtime(_Object, _RiakClient) ->
	% Do Nothing function -- These hooks are called in predictable
	% but complex ways especially as the number of replication 
	% sites (Version 2 Replication) or sinks (Version 3 Replication)
	% increase.  
	ok.
 
send(_Object, _RiakClient) ->
	% Do Nothing function -- These hooks are called in predictable
	% but complex ways especially as the number of replication 
	% sites (Version 2 Replication) or sinks (Version 3 Replication)
	% increase.  
	ok.
```

Save the above code to your computer as `riak_replication_hook_sample.erl`.

To install the sample hook,

* Compile `riak_replication_hook_sample.erl`

  **Note on the Erlang Compiler**: You must use the Erlang compiler (`erlc`) associated with the Riak installation or the version of Erlang used when compiling Riak from source. For packaged Riak installations, you can consult Table 1 below for the default location of Riak’s erlc for each supported platform. If you compiled from source, use the erlc from the Erlang version you used to compile Riak.

  Distribution | Path
  --- | ---
  CentOS & RHEL Linux    | /usr/lib64/riak/erts-5.9.1/bin/erlc |
  Debian & Ubuntu Linux	| /usr/lib/riak/erts-5.9.1/bin/erlc |
  FreeBSD	| /usr/local/lib/riak/erts-5.9.1/bin/erlc |
  SmartOS	| /opt/local/lib/riak/erts-5.9.1/bin/erlc
  Solaris 10	| /opt/riak/lib/erts-5.9.1/bin/erlc

  **Table 1**: Erlang compiler executable location for packaged Riak installations on supported platforms

  Once you have determined the location of the Erlang compiler, compiling (on Ubuntu  for example) is as simple as:

   ```
   /usr/lib/riak/erts-5.9.1/bin/erlc riak_replication_hook_sample.erl
   ```

* Copy the `riak_replication_hook_sample.beam` file to the subdirectory you want to store the custom hook
   
   ```
   cp riak_replication_hook_sample.beam /path/to/replication/hook
   ```
   
* Add a `-pa` argument to your `vm.args` file

   ``` 
   -pa /path/to/replication/hook
   ```
   
* Add a `-run` argument to your `vm.args` file

   ``` 
   -run riak_repl_hook_sample register
   ```


### [Replication Hook API](id:ReplicationHookApi)


A replication hook must implement the following functions:

#### `send_realtime/2` ([riak_object](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/blob/master/src/riak_object.erl), RiakClient) -> ok | cancel | [[riak_object](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/blob/{{VERSION}}/src/riak_object.erl)]

   This hook controls whether an object replicated in realtime should be sent.  To send this 
   object, return 'ok', to prevent the object from being sent return 'cancel', or you can also
   return a list of riak objects to be replicated immediately *before* the current object. This 
   is useful for when you have an object that refers to other objects—a chunked file, for 
   example—and want to be sure all the dependency objects are replicated before the dependent
   object.
   
#### `send/2` ([riak_object](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/blob/{{VERSION}}/src/riak_object.erl), RiakClient) -> ok | cancel | [riak_object]

   This hook is used in fullsync replication. To send this object, return 'ok', to prevent 
   the object from being sent return 'cancel', or you can also return a list of riak objects 
   to be replicated immediately *before* the current object. This is useful for when you have
   an object that refers to other objects—a chunked file, for example—and want to be sure all the 
   dependency objects are replicated before the dependent object.

#### `recv/1` ([riak_object](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/blob/{{VERSION}}/src/riak_object.erl)) -> ok | cancel

   When an object is received by the client site, this hook is run. You can use
   it to update some metadata, or to deny the object.
