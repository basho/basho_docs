The `fullsync_interval` parameter can be configured in the `riak-repl` section of [[app.config|Configuration Files#app.config]] with:

* a single integer value representing the duration to wait *in minutes* between fullsyncs

    **OR**


* a list of `[{"clustername", time_in_minutes}`, `{"clustername", time_in_minutes}`, `â€¦]` pairs for each sink participating in fullsync replication. Note the commas separating each pair, and `[` `]` surrounding the entire list.

##Examples

Sharing a fullsync time (in minutes) for all sinks:

```erlang
{riak_repl, [
   {data_root, "/configured/repl/data/root"},
   {fullsync_interval, 90} %% fullsync runs every 90 minutes
  ]}
```

List of multiple sinks with separate times in minutes:

```erlang
{riak_repl, [
   {data_root, "/configured/repl/data/root"},
   % clusters sink_boston + sink_newyork have difference intervals (in minutes)
   {fullsync_interval, [
                {"sink_boston", 120},  %% fullsync to sink_boston with run every 120 minutes
                {"sink_newyork", 90}]} %% fullsync to sink_newyork with run every 90 minutes
  ]}
```

## Additional fullsync stats

Additional fullsync stats per sink have been added in Riak Enterprise.

* `fullsyncs_completed`: The number of fullsyncs that have been completed to the specified sink cluster.
* `fullsync_start_time`: The time the current fullsink to the specified cluster began.
* `last_fullsync_duration`: The duration (in seconds) of the last completed fullsync.
