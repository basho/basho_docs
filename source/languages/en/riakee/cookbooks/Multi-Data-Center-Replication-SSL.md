## Features

Riak REPL SSL support consists of the following items:

  * Encryption of replication data
  * SSL certificate chain validation
  * SSL common name whitelisting support

## SSL Configuration

To configure SSL, you will need to include the following four settings
in the `riak-repl` section of your `app.config`:

```appconfig
{riak-repl, [
             % ...
             {ssl_enabled, true},
             {certfile, "/full/path/to/site1-cert.pem"},
             {keyfile, "/full/path/to/site1-key.pem"},
             {cacertdir, "/full/path/to/cacertsdir"}
             % ...
            ]}

```

The `cacertdir` is a directory containing all of the CA certificates
needed to verify the CA chain back to the root.

## Verifying Peer Certificates

Verification of a peer's certificate common name is enabled by using the 
`peer_common_name_acl` property in the `riak_repl` section of your
`app.config`.

You can provide multiple ACLs, separated by commas, and you can wildcard
the leftmost part of the common name. For example, `*.corp.com` would
match `site3.corp.com` but not `foo.bar.corp.com` or `corp.com`. If the
ACL is specified and not the special value `"*"`, certificates not
matching any of the rules will not be allowed to connect.

If no ACLs are configured, no checks on the common name are done.

### Examples

The following example will only allow connections from peer certificate
names like `db.bashosamplecorp.com` and `security.bashosamplecorp.com`:

```appconfig
{riak_repl, [
             % ...
             {peer_common_name_acl, ["db.bashosamplecorp.com", "security.bashosamplecorp.com"]}
             % ...
            ]}
```

The following example will allow connections from peer certificate names
like `foo.bashosamplecorp.com` or `db.bashosamplecorp.com`, but not a
peer certificate name like `db.backup.bashosamplecorp.com`:

```appconfig
{riak_repl, [
             % ...
             {peer_common_name_acl, ["*.bashosamplecorp.com"]}
             % ...
            ]}

```

This example will match any peer certificate name (and is the default):

```appconfig
{riak_repl, [
             % ...
             {peer_common_name_acl, "*"}
             % ...
            ]}
```

## SSL CA Validation

You can adjust the way CA certificates are validated by adding the
following to the `riak_repl` section of your `app.config`:

```erlang
{riak_repl, [
             % ...
             {ssl_depth, ...}
             % ...
            ]}
```

**Note**: `ssl_depth` takes an integer parameter.

The depth specifies the maximum number of intermediate certificates that
may follow the peer certificate in a valid certification path. The
intermediate certificates must not be self signed.

For example:

  * A depth of 0 indicates that the certificate must be signed directly
    by a root certificate authority (CA)
  * A depth of 1 indicates that the certificate may be signed by at most
    1 intermediate CA's, followed by a root CA
  * A depth of 2 indicates that the certificate may be signed by at most
    2 intermediate CA's, followed by a root CA

## Compatibility

Replication SSL is ONLY available in Riak 1.2+.

If SSL is enabled and a connection is made to a Riak Enterprise 1.0 or
1.1 node, the connection will be denied and an error will be logged.

### Self-Signed Certificates

You can generate your own CA and keys by using [this
guide](http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/618).

Make sure that you remove the password protection from the keys you
generate.
