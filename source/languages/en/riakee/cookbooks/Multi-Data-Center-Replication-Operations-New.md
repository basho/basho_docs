## Riak 1.3 Replication Technology Preview Commands
## The riak-repl Command

Replication is controlled by the `riak-repl` command. Usage:

## Cluster Connectivity

**clustername**

Set the `clustername` for all nodes in a Riak cluster. *This only needs to be run once on a single node of a cluster for the changes to propagate to all other nodes.*

To **set** the clustername:

  * *Syntax:* `riak-repl clustername <clustername>`
  * *Example:* `riak-repl clustername Boston`

To **get** the clustername:

  * *Syntax:* `riak-repl clustername`
  * *Example:* `riak-repl clustername`


**connect**

The `connect` command establishes communications from a source cluster to a sink cluster.  The host:port of the sink cluster is used for this.  Host can be either an IP address or a hostname that will resolve to one. The IP and port to connect to can be found in the app.config of the remote cluster, under `riak_core » cluster_mgr`. Once a connection is established, one can continue to configure real time or fullsync replication.

**NOTE** 

The cluster_mgr configuration variable in app.config must be an IP; it may not be a hostname.

* *Syntax* `riak-repl connect <ip>:<port>`
* *Syntax*	`riak-repl connect <host>:<port>`

* *Example* `riak-repl connect 192.168.2.1:8085`
* *Example*	 `riak-repl connect Austin:8085`


**disconnect**

Disconnecting a source cluster from a sink cluser can be done either by host:port or by using the name of cluster.

* *Syntax* `riak-repl disconnect <host>:<port>`
* *Example* `riak-repl disconnect 192.168.2.1:8085`

* *Syntax* `riak-repl disconnect <sink_clustername>`
* *Example* `riak-repl disconnect Austin`



##Realtime Replication Configuration

**realtime enable**

**realtime disable**

Enable or disable realtime replication from a source cluster to sink clusters.

* *Syntax* `riak-repl realtime enable <sink_clustername>`
* *Syntax* `riak-repl realtime disable <sink_clustername>`

* *Example* `riak-repl realtime enable Austin`
* *Example* `riak-repl realtime disable Austin`


**realtime start**

**realtime stop**

Start or stop realtime replication from a source cluster to sink clusters.

* *Syntax* `riak-repl realtime start <sink_clustername>`
* *Syntax* `riak-repl realtime stop <sink_clustername>`

* *Syntax* `riak-repl realtime start <sink_clustername>`
* *Syntax* `riak-repl realtime stop <sink_clustername>`


To start or stop replication for all configured sink clusters:


* *Example* `riak-repl realtime start`
* *Example* `riak-repl realtime stop`


##Fullsync Replication Configuration

**fullsync enable**

**fullsync disable**

By default, a fullsync will start as soon as a connection is established to the remote cluster.  This behavior can be altered by using the app.config `fullsync_on_connect`.

* *Syntax* `riak-repl fullsync enable <sink_clustername>`
* *Syntax* `riak-repl fullsync disable <sink_clustername>`

* *Example* `riak-repl fullsync enable Austin`
* *Example* `riak-repl fullsync disable Austin`


**fullsync start**

**fullsync stop**

Starts or stops a fullsync. 

If the application configuration `fullsync_on_connect` is set to false, a fullsync needs to be started manually.  This is also used to periodically fullsync using a cron job.  While a fullsync is in progress, a start command is ignored; a message is logged.

* *Syntax* `riak-repl fullsync start <sink_clustername>`
* *Syntax* `riak-repl fullsync stop <sink_clustername>`

* *Enable* `riak-repl fullsync start Austin`
* *Enable* `riak-repl fullsync stop Austin`


##Tuning

**fullsync max_fssource_node**

The `max_fssource_node` limits the number of fullsync workers that will be running on each individual node in a source cluster.  This is a hard limit for all fullsyncs enabled; additional fullsync configurations will not increase the number of fullsync workers allowed to run on any node. This value defaults to 2. This only affects nodes on the source cluster on which this parameter is defined via the configuration file or command line. This value can be made persistent via the `max_fssource_node` configuration variable in app.config. See the Configuration guide for more information.

Example: 

* *Syntax* `riak-repl fullsync max_fssource_node <value>`
* *Default* 1

* *Example* `riak-repl fullsync max_fssource_node 2`

**fullsync max_fssource_cluster**

The ‘max_fssource_cluster’ is the hard limit of fullsync workers that will be running on the source side of a cluster across all nodes on that cluster for a fullsync to a sink cluster.  This means if one has configured fullsync for two different clusters, both with a max_fssource_cluster of 5, 10 fullsync workers can be in progress.  This value defaults to 5. Only affects nodes on the source cluster on which this parameter is defined via the configuration file or command line. This value can be made persistent via the `max_fssource_cluster` configuration variable in app.config. See the Configuration guide for more information.

Example: 

* *Syntax* `riak-repl fullsync max_fssource_cluster <value>`
* *Default* 5

* *Example* `riak-repl fullsync max_fssource_cluster 5`


**fullsync max_fssink_node**

The ‘max_fssink_node’ limits the number of fullsync workers allowed to run on each individual node in a sink cluster.  This is a hard limit for all fullsync sources interacting with the sink cluster. Thus, multiple simultaneous source connections to the sink cluster will have to share the sink node’s number of maximum connections. This value defaults to 2. Only affects nodes on the sink cluster on which this parameter is defined via the configuration file or command line. This value can be made persistent via the `max_fssink_cluster` configuration variable in app.config. See the Configuration guide for more information.


* *Syntax* `riak-repl fullsync max_fssink_cluster <value>`
* *Default* 1

* *Example* `riak-repl fullsync max_fssink_cluster 5`


##Mixing Replication v 1.2 with Replication v 1.3

Riak Replication v 1.2 and Replication v 1.3 can be safely used at the same time. If you choose to move to 1.3 Replication completely, it is recommended to disable 1.2 realtime replication bucket hooks with the `riak-repl modes` command. 

**riak-repl modes**

* *Syntax* `riak-repl modes <modelist>` 
	* `modelist` is one or both of mode_repl12, mode_repl13 separated by ***spaces*** (without commas).

* *Example* 

```
riak-repl modes mode_repl12 mode_repl13
Current replication modes: [mode_repl12,mode_repl13]
```

To check the current replication modes:

* *Syntax* `riak-repl modes` 

* *Example*
```
riak-repl modes
Current replication modes: [mode_repl12,mode_repl13]
```



##riak-repl status output
=======

The following definitions describe the output of `riak-repl status`. Please note that many of these statistics will only appear on the current leader node. Riak 1.2 and 1.3 replication statistics are both obtained by using the `riak-repl status` command.

**All statistic counts will be reset to 0 upon restarting Riak EE unless otherwise noted.**

### Accessing Replication web-based statistics

These stats can be accessed via the command line with the following command:

	curl -q http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak-repl/stats

A simple way to view formatted statistics is to use a command such as:
	
	curl -q http://127.0.0.1:8091/riak-repl/stats | python -mjson.tool
