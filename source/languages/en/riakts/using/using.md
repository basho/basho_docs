Now that you've downloaded the package from ZenDesk and [installed][installing] Riak TS, there's a recommended path for setting up and using it:

1. [Plan][planning] your Riak TS table. Once created, tables can't be edited, so it's important to get it right the first time.
2. [Create and activate][activating] your Riak TS table. (You'll need `sudo` and `su` access for this step.)
3. [Write data][writing] to your table.

Once you've completed these steps you can go on to [query][querying] your data or [customize your Riak TS configuration][configuring].
