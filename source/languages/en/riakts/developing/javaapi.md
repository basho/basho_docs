You can develop with Riak TS through the Java client. This document covers the Java protobuf requests to Riak TS.

## Overview

There are two packages that cover the public API for TS in the Java client.  The `com.basho.riak.client.api.commands.timeseries` package contains executable commands, and the `com.basho.riak.client.core.query.timeseries` package contains the common data types.

## Data Types

 * Cell - Holds a single piece of data. 
 * Row - Holds a collection of Cells.
 * ColumnDescription - A Metadata description of a column in a Time Series table.
 * QueryResult - Holds a result set from a query, keylist, or fetch command.

### Data Types Details

####`Cell`
Holds a piece of data for a Time Series Row.
Note: Cells are immutable once created.

A cell can hold 5 different types of raw data:

**Varchar**s, which can hold byte arrays. Commonly used to store encoded strings.
**SInt64**s, which can hold any signed 64-bit integers.
**Double**s, which can hold any 64-bit floating point numbers.
**Timestamp**s, which can hold any unix/epoch timestamp. Millisecond resolution is required.
**Boolean**s, which can hold a true/false value. 

##### Constructors
There are Cell constructors that accept Strings(Varchar type), Longs(SInt64 type), Double (Double type), Boolean (Boolean type), Calendar (Timestamp type), and Date(Timestamp type).  There is also a special static helper for creating Cells with raw timestamps. 

 * `public Cell(String varcharValue)`
 * `public Cell(long sint64Value)`
 * `public Cell(double doubleValue)`
 * `public Cell(boolean booleanValue)`
 * `public Cell(Calendar timestampValue)`
 * `public Cell(Date timestampValue)`
 * `public static Cell newTimestamp(long value)`

##### Instance Methods
There are `has_X` and `get_X` methods for each data type. 


####`Row`
Holds a collection of cells. 
Note: Rows are immutable once created.

##### Constructors

 * `public Row(Collection<Cell> cells)`
 * `public Row(Cell... cells)`

##### Public Instance Methods

 * `int getCellsCount()` - Gets the total count of all cells in this row. 
 * `List<Cell> getCellsCopy()` - Returns a shallow copy of the immutable cell collection.
 * `Iterator<Cell> iterator()` - Returns an iterator to the immutable cell collection.


####`ColumnDescription`
A Metadata description of a column in Riak Time Series.
Contains a column name and column type.

##### Constructors

 * `ColumnDescription(String name, ColumnType type)`

##### Public Instance Methods

 * `string getName()` - Returns the name of the column.
 * `ColumnType getType()` - Returns the type of the column.

##### Public Subclasses
 * `ColumnType` - Holds an enumeration of all the column types. 

```
public enum ColumnType
    {
        VARCHAR,
        SINT64,
        DOUBLE,
        TIMESTAMP,
        BOOLEAN
    }
```

####`QueryResult`
Holds a result set from a query, keylist, or fetch.
Note: QueryResults are immutable.

##### Constructors

There are no public constructors for QueryResults.

##### Public Instance Methods

 * `List<ColumnDescription> getColumnDescriptionsCopy()` - Returns a deep copy of the Query Result's Column Descriptions (if any).
 * `int getRowCount()` - Gets the total count of all rows in this result. 
 * `List<Row> getRowsCopy()` - Returns a shallow copy of the immutable row collection.
 * `Iterator<Row> iterator()` - Returns an iterator to the immutable row collection.



##Command Classes Index

All command classes have a static inner `Builder` class to create and build each command. 

* Delete - Deletes a single time series row by it's key values.
* Fetch - Fetches a single time series row by it's key values.
* ListKeys - Lists the primary keys of all the rows in a Time Series table.
* Query - Allows you to query a Time Series table, with the given query string.
* Store - Stores data into the Time Series table.


###Command Classes Details

Each command is created through a static Builder subclass.  This pattern ensures that the commands are created as correctly as possible.  To create the command from the builder, call the `.build()` method. 

To execute any command, you must have an instance of a `RiakClient` object. You then pass the command object as a parameter into the `execute()` or `executeAsync()` methods.

```java
RiakClient client = RiakClient.newClient(10017, "myriakdb.host");

String queryText = "select weather, temperature from GeoCheckin " +
                   "where time > 1234560 and time < 1234569 and " +
                   "myfamily = 'family1' and myseries = 'series1'";

Query query = new Query.Builder(queryText).build();

// With the synchronous execute, any errors encountered will be thrown.
QueryResult queryResult = client.execute(query);

// With the executeAsync method, any errors will be stored for review.
final RiakFuture<QueryResult, String> queryFuture = client.executeAsync(storeCmd);
bool success = queryFuture.isSuccess();
QueryResult result = queryFuture.get();
Throwable error = queryFuture.cause();
```

####`Delete`

Deletes a single time series row by it's key values.

##### Builder
The builder for the Delete command takes the table name, and a list of cells that identify the primary key.  The order of the cells must match the order of the values in the primary key.

 * `public Builder(String tableName, List<Cell> keyValues)`

 There is also an instance method to specify a command timeout in milliseconds.

 * `public Builder withTimeout(int timeout)`

##### Return Value
 * `void`

####`Fetch` 

Fetches a single time series row by it's key values.

##### Builder
The builder for the Fetch command takes the table name, and a list of cells that identify the primary key.  The order of the cells must match the order of the values in the primary key.

* `public Builder(String tableName, List<Cell> keyValues)`

 There is also an instance method to specify a command timeout in milliseconds.

 * `public Builder withTimeout(int timeout)`

##### Return Value

* `QueryResult` - with 1 row if a match was found, or 0 rows if it wasn't. 

####`ListKeys`

Lists the primary keys of all the rows in a Time Series table.

##### Builder
The builder only takes the table name to list keys from.

 * `public Builder(String tableName)`

 There is also an instance method to specify a command timeout in milliseconds.

 * `public Builder withTimeout(int timeout)`

##### Return Value
* `QueryResult` - with each PrimaryKey's cells as a row. May not contain values for ColumnDescriptions.

####`Query`

Allows you to query a Time Series table, with the given query string.

##### Builder
The builder only takes the query text.
 * `public Builder(String queryText)`

##### Return Value
 * `QueryResult` - contains all matching rows.

####`Store`
Stores data into the Time Series table.

##### Builder
The builder constructor takes the table name.	
 *`public Builder(String tableName)`

 To add rows to store, use one of the `withRow()` or `withRows()` methods.

  * `public Builder withRow(Row row)`
  * `public Builder withRows(Collection<Row> rows)`

##### Return Value
* `void`
