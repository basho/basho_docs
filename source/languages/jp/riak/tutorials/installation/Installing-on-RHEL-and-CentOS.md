When installing Riak on CentOS or Redhat you can install from source or from our custom .rpm package.

## Notes

* CentOS enables SE Linux by default and you may need to disable SE Linux if you encounter errors.
* Erlang OTP R15B01 and Riak Enterprise 1.2 do not work on CentOS 5.2, but do work on CentOS 5.3 and newer.

## Installing From Our Custom .rpm Package

### For Centos 5 / RHEL 5

```bash
wget http://downloads.basho.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/riak/1.2/1.2.1/rhel/5/riak-1.2.1-1.el5.x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh riak-1.2.1-1.el5.x86_64.rpm
```

### For Centos 6 / RHEL 6

```bash
wget http://downloads.basho.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/riak/1.2/1.2.1/rhel/6/riak-1.2.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh riak-1.2.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
```

## Installing From Source
Riak requires [[Erlang|http://www.erlang.org/]] R15B01. *Note: don't use Erlang version R15B02, for the moment, as it causes an [error with riak-admin status](https://github.com/basho/riak/issues/227) commands*.

If you do not have Erlang already installed, see our guide to [[Installing Erlang]]. Don’t worry, it’s easy!

Building from source will require the following packages:

* gcc
* gcc-c++
* glibc-devel
* make

You can install these with yum:

```bash
sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ glibc-devel make git
```

Now we can download and install Riak:

```bash
wget http://downloads.basho.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/riak/1.2/1.2.1/riak-1.2.1.tar.gz
tar zxvf riak-1.2.1.tar.gz
cd riak-1.2.1
make rel
```

You will now have a fresh build of Riak in the `rel/riak` directory.
