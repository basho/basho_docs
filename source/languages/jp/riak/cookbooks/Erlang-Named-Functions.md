Riak supports the use of Erlang named functions in compiled modules for
pre-commit hooks, post-commit hooks, and MapReduce operations. This cookbook
explains the process for using your own named functions, including module
compilation, configuration, and installation steps with simple examples
detailed for each use case.

## Pre-Commit Hook Example

For the pre-commit hook example, we'll define a function to validate the
JSON content of a key's value before writing the key and value to the
bucket that the pre-commit hook is installed into.

Here is our example pre-commit `validate_json` module and its
corresponding `validate` function:

```erlang
-module(validate_json).
-export([validate/1]).

validate(Object) ->
  try
    mochijson2:decode(riak_object:get_value(Object)),
    Object
  catch
    throw:invalid_utf8 ->
      {fail, "Invalid JSON: Illegal UTF-8 character"};
    error:Error ->
      {fail, "Invalid JSON: " ++ binary_to_list(list_to_binary(io_lib:format("~p", [Error])))}
  end.
```

Save this file as `validate_json.erl` and proceed to compiling the module.

<div class="info"><div class="title">Note on the Erlang Compiler</div> You

         on supported platforms

Compiling the module is a straightforward process.

```text
erlc validate_json.erl
```

Next, you'll need to define a path from which compiled modules can be stored
and loaded. For our example, we'll use a temporary directory `/tmp/beams`,
but you should choose a directory for production functions based on your
own requirements such that they will be available where and when needed.

Successful compilation will result in a new `.beam` file,
`validate_json.beam`. Copy this file to the `/tmp/beams` directory.

```text
cp validate_json.beam /tmp/beams/
```

After copying the compiled module into `/tmp/beams/`, you must update
`app.config` and configure Riak to allow loading of compiled modules from
the directory where they're stored (again in our example case, `/tmp/beams`).

Edit `app.config` and insert an `add_paths` setting into the `riak_kv`
section as shown:

```erlang
{riak_kv, [
  %% ...
  {add_paths, ["/tmp/beams/"]},
  %% ...
```

After updating `app.config`, Riak must be restarted. In production cases, you
should ensure that if you are adding configuration changes to multiple nodes,
that you do so in a rolling fashion, taking time to ensure that the Riak key
value store has fully initialized and become available for use.

This is done with the `riak-admin wait-for-service` command as detailed
in the [Commands documentation](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/Command-Line-Tools---riak-admin/#wait-for-service).

<div class="note">It is important that you ensure riak_kv is
active before restarting the next node.</div>

Once Riak is restarted, all that remains is to install the pre-commit
hook into the target bucket(s) you wish it to operate on. In this example,
we've just one bucket, named `messages`, which we're going to install our
`validate` pre-commit function into.

You can use Riak's HTTP interface and the `curl` command line utility to
install your named functions into into the relevant bucket(s). For our
example, we'll install the `validate_json` module with its `validate`
function into our `messages` bucket, like this:

```bash
curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/messages/props    \
-d '{"props":{"precommit":[{"mod": "validate_json", "fun": "validate"}]}}'
```

Check that the bucket has your pre-commit hook listed in its properties.

```bash
curl localhost:8098/buckets/messages/props | python -mjson.tool
```

The output should look like this:

```json
{
    "props": {
        "allow_mult": false,
        "basic_quorum": false,
        "big_vclock": 50,
        "chash_keyfun": {
            "fun": "chash_std_keyfun",
            "mod": "riak_core_util"
        },
        "dw": "quorum",
        "last_write_wins": false,
        "linkfun": {
            "fun": "mapreduce_linkfun",
            "mod": "riak_kv_wm_link_walker"
        },
        "n_val": 3,
        "name": "messages",
        "notfound_ok": true,
        "old_vclock": 86400,
        "postcommit": [],
        "pr": 0,
        "precommit": [
            {
                "fun": "validate_json",
                "mod": "validate"
            }
        ],
        "pw": 0,
        "r": "quorum",
        "rw": "quorum",
        "small_vclock": 50,
        "w": "quorum",
        "young_vclock": 20
    }
}
```

You can see that `precommit` is indeed set to our `validate_json` module and
`validate` function. Now you can test the pre-commit hook function by posting
some objects with JSON values including some with invalid JSON.

```bash
curl -XPUT localhost:8098/buckets/messages/keys/1 \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d@msg3.json
```

The response when `msg3.json` contains invalid JSON:

```bash
Invalid JSON: {case_clause,{{const,<<"authorName">>},{decoder,null,160,1,161,comma}}}
```

## Post-Commit Hook Example

For the post-commit example, we'll define a simple function to log the object
values to `console.log` after they are successfully written to Riak.

Here is our example post-commit function:

```erlang
-module(log_object).
-export([log/1]).

log(Object) ->
  error_logger:info_msg("OBJECT: ~p~n",[Object]).
```

Save this file as `log_object.erl` and proceed to compiling the module.

<div class="info"><div class="title">Note on the Erlang Compiler</div> You
must use the Erlang compiler (<tt>erlc</tt>) associated with the Riak
installation or the version of Erlang used when compiling Riak from source.

Compiling the module is straightforward:

```bash
erlc log_object.erl
```

Next, you'll need to define a path from which compiled modules can be stored
and loaded. For our example, we'll use a temporary directory `/tmp/beams`,
but you should choose a directory for production functions based on your
own requirements such that they will be available where and when needed.

Successful compilation will result in a new `.beam` file:
`log_object.beam`. Copy this file to the `/tmp/beams` directory.

```bash
cp log_object.beam /tmp/beams/
```

After copying the compiled module into `/tmp/beams/`, you must update
`app.config` and configure Riak to allow loading of compiled modules from
the directory where they're stored (again in our example case, `/tmp/beams`).


Edit `app.config` and insert an `add_paths` setting into the `riak_kv`
section as shown:

```erlang
{riak_kv, [
  %% ...
  {add_paths, ["/tmp/beams/"]},
  %% ...
```

After updating `app.config`, Riak must be restarted. In production cases, you
should ensure that if you are adding configuration changes to multiple nodes,
that you do so in a rolling fashion, taking time to ensure that the Riak key
value store has fully initialized and become available for use.

This is done with the `riak-admin wait-for-service` command as detailed
in the [Commands documentation](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/references/Command-Line-Tools---riak-admin/#wait-for-service).

<div class="note">It is important that you ensure riak_kv is
active before restarting the next node.</div>

Once Riak is restarted, all that remains is to install the post-commit
hook on the target bucket(s) you wish it to operate on. In this example,
we've just one bucket, named `updates`, which we're going to install our
`log` function into.

You can use Riak's HTTP interface and the `curl` command line utility to
install your named functions into into the relevant buckets. For our example,
we'll install the `log_object` module and its `log` function into our
`messages` bucket, like this.

```bash
curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://127.0.0.1:8098/buckets/updates/props    \
-d '{"props":{"postcommit":[{"mod": "log_object", "fun": "log"}]}}'
```

Check that the bucket has your post-commit hook listed in its properties.

```bash
curl localhost:8098/buckets/updates/props | python -mjson.tool
```

The output should look like this:

```json
{
    "props": {
        "allow_mult": false,
        "basic_quorum": false,
        "big_vclock": 50,
        "chash_keyfun": {
            "fun": "chash_std_keyfun",
            "mod": "riak_core_util"
        },
        "dw": "quorum",
        "last_write_wins": false,
        "linkfun": {
            "fun": "mapreduce_linkfun",
            "mod": "riak_kv_wm_link_walker"
        },
        "n_val": 3,
        "name": "updates",
        "notfound_ok": true,
        "old_vclock": 86400,
        "postcommit": [
            {
                "fun": "log",
                "mod": "log_object"
            }
        ],
        "pr": 0,
        "precommit": [],
        "pw": 0,
        "r": "quorum",
        "rw": "quorum",
        "small_vclock": 50,
        "w": "quorum",
        "young_vclock": 20
    }
}
```

You can see that `postcommit` is indeed set to our `log_object` module and
`log` function. Now you can test the post-commit function by posting an
object and viewing `console.log`.

```bash
curl -XPUT localhost:8098/buckets/updates/keys/2 \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d@msg2.json
```

You can see the logged value of the object by viewing `console.log`.

```bash

```

## MapReduce Example

For the MapReduce example, we'll define a simple module that implements a
map function to return the key value pairs contained and use it in a MapReduce query via Riak's HTTP API.

Here is our example MapReduce function:

```erlang
-module(mr_example).

-export([get_keys/3]).

%Returns bucket and key pairs from a map phase
get_keys(Value,_Keydata,_Arg) ->
  [{riak_object:bucket(Value),riak_object:key(Value)}].
```

Save this file as `mr_example.erl` and proceed to compiling the module.

<div class="info"><div class="title">Note on the Erlang Compiler</div> You
must use the Erlang compiler (<tt>erlc</tt>) associated with the Riak
installation or the version of Erlang used when compiling Riak from source.
For packaged Riak installations, you can consult Table 1 above for the
default location of Riak's <tt>erlc</tt> for each supported platform.
If you compiled from source, use the <tt>erlc</tt> from the Erlang version
you used to compile Riak.</div>


Compiling the module is a straightforward process:

```bash
erlc mr_example.erl
```

Next, you'll need to define a path from which to store and load compiled
modules. For our example, we'll use a temporary directory (`/tmp/beams`),
but you should choose a different directory for production functions
such that they will be available where needed.

Successful compilation will result in a new `.beam` file:
`validate_json.beam`. Copy this file to the `/tmp/beams` directory.

```bash
cp mr_example.beam /tmp/beams/
```

After copying the compiled module into `/tmp/beams/`, you must update
`app.config` to configure Riak to allow loading of compiled modules from
the directory where they're stored (again in our example, `/tmp/beams`).

Edit `app.config` and insert an `add_paths` setting into the `riak_kv`
section as shown:

```erlang
{riak_kv, [
  %% ...
  {add_paths, ["/tmp/beams/"]},
  %% ...
```

After updating `app.config`, Riak must be restarted. In production cases, you
should ensure that if you are adding configuration changes to multiple nodes,
that you do so in a rolling fashion, taking time to ensure that the Riak key
value store has fully initialized and become available for use.

This is done with the `riak-admin wait-for-service` command as detailed
in the [[[Commands documentation|Command-Line-Tools---riak-admin#wait-for-service]].

<div class="note">It is important that you ensure riak_kv is
active before restarting the next node.</div>

Once Riak is restarted, all that remains is to try the custom function
in a MapReduce query. For example, let's return keys contained within the
**messages** bucket:

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:8098/mapred \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   \
   -d '{"inputs":"messages",
          "query":[{"map":{
          "language":"erlang",
          "module":"mr_example",
          "function":"get_keys"}}]}'
```

The results should look similar to this:

```bash
{"messages":"4","messages":"1","messages":"3","messages":"2"}
```

<div class="info">Be sure to install the MapReduce function as described
above on all of the nodes in your cluster to ensure proper operation.</div>
