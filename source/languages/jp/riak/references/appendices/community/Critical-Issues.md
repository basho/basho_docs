The Basho Dev Team does all that it can to ensure our users are kept up-to-date on critical bugs and issues that may occur. In addition to making Riak bugs public and searchable at [https://issues.basho.com], there are two additional avenues to monitor critical issues:

* [Riak Critical Issues Mailing List](http://lists.basho.com/mailman/listinfo/riak-critical-issues_lists.basho.com) - A very *low* traffic list used to disseminate information about bugs or issues that might negatively impact a production Riak cluster or deal with data integrity. 
* Project Issues are all managed under their respective [Basho github repos](https://github.com/basho/).
  A few good repos to pay particular attention to are:
    * [Riak issues](https://github.com/basho/riak/issues)
    * [Riak Core issues](https://github.com/basho/riak_core/issues)
    * [Riak KV issues](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/issues)
    * [Riak Search issues](https://github.com/basho/riak_search/issues)
    * [Bitcask issues](https://github.com/basho/bitcask/issues)
    * [eLevelDB issues](https://github.com/basho/eleveldb/issues)
