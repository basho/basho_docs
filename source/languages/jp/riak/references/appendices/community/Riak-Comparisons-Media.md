* [[Choosing The Right NoSQL Database - 4Developers|http://www.slideshare.net/juokaz/choosing-the-right-nosql-database-4developers]] - A whirlwind tour of a few NoSQL solutions, learning the very different ways they represent data and seeing their unique strengths and weaknesses in various kinds of applications. Along the way, we'll learn why new technologies must be introduced to address today's scaling challenges, and what compromises we'll have to make if we want to abandon the databases of our youth.
