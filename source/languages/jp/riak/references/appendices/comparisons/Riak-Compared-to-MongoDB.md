---

This is intended to be a brief, objective and technical comparison of Riak and MongoDB.  The MongoDB version described is 2.2.x. The Riak version described is Riak 1.1.x. If you feel this comparison is unfaithful at all for whatever reason, please [fix it](https://github.com/basho/basho_docs/issues/new) or send an email to **docs@basho.com**.

## At A Very High Level

* Riak is Apache 2.0 licensed; MongoDB is distributed under the AGPL
* Riak is written primarily in Erlang with some bits in C; MongoDB is written in C++

## Feature/Capability Comparison

The table below gives a high level comparison of Riak and MongoDB features/capabilities.  To keep this page relevant in the face of rapid development on both sides, low level details are found in links to Riak and MongoDB online documentation.

	<tr>
        <td>Data Versioning and Consistency</td>
        <td> Riak uses a data structure called a vector clock to reason about causality and staleness of stored values. Vector clocks enable clients to always write to the database in exchange for consistency conflicts being resolved at read time by either application or client code. Vector clocks can be configured to store copies of a given datum based on size and age of said datum.   There is also an option to disable vector clocks and fall back to simple time-stamp based "last-write-wins".

        <td>MongoDB exhibits strong consistency.  Eventually consistent reads can be accomplished via secondaries.  A MongoDB  cluster (with auto-sharding and replication) has a master server at a given point in time for each shard.

        <td>Concurrency</td>
        <td> In Riak, any node in the cluster can coordinate a read/write operation for any other node. Riak stresses availability for writes and reads, and puts the burden of resolution on the client at read time.
		 </td>
		
        <td>MongoDB relies on locks for consistency. As of version 2.2, MongoDB has a DB Level Lock for all operations.

    <tr>
        <td>Replication</td>
        <td>Riak's replication system is heavily influenced by the Dynamo Paper and Dr. Eric Brewer's CAP Theorem. Riak uses consistent hashing to replicate and distribute N copies of each value around a Riak cluster composed of any number of physical machines. Under the hood, Riak uses virtual nodes to handle the distribution and dynamic rebalancing of data, thus decoupling the data distribution from physical assets.
			<ul>
			  <li>[[Replication]]</li>
			  <li>[[Clustering|Concepts#Clustering]]</li>
			</ul>
			
			The Riak APIs expose tunable consistency and availability parameters that let you select which level configuration is best for your use case. Replication is configurable at the bucket level when first storing data in Riak. Subsequent reads and writes to that data can have request-level parameters.

        <td>Scaling Out and In</td>
        <td>Riak allows you to elastically grow and shrink your cluster while evenly balancing the load on each machine. No node in Riak is special or has any particular role. In other words, all nodes are masterless. When you add a physical machine to Riak, the cluster is made aware of its membership via gossiping of ring state. Once it's a member of the ring, it's assigned an equal percentage of the partitions and subsequently takes ownership of the data belonging to those partitions. The process for removing a machine is the inverse of this. Riak also ships with a comprehensive suite of command line tools to help make node operations simple and straightforward.

        <td>Mongo relies on sharding for scaling out. This involves designating a certain server to hold certain chunks of the data as the data set grows.
