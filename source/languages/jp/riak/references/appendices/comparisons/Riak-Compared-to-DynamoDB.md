version: 1.3.0+
document: appendix

keywords: [comparisons, dynamodb]
---

This is intended to be a brief, objective, and technical comparison of Riak and Amazon DynamoDB.  The DynamoDB version described is API Version 2011-12-05. The Riak version described is Riak 1.3.x. If you feel this comparison is unfaithful at all for whatever reason, please [fix it](https://github.com/basho/basho_docs/issues/new) or send an email to **docs@basho.com**.

## At A Very High Level

* Riak is an Apache 2.0 open source licensed project. DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that is provided by Amazon as part of Amazon Web Services.
* Because DynamoDB is a database service, its implementation details (language, architecture, etc.) cannot be verified.

## Feature/Capability Comparison

The table below gives a high level comparison of Riak and DynamoDB features/capabilities.  To keep this page relevant in the face of rapid development on both sides, low level details are found in links to Riak and DynamoDB's online documentation.

        <td>Data Versioning and Consistency</td>
        <td> Riak uses a data structure called a vector clock to reason about causality and staleness of stored values. Vector clocks enable clients to always write to the database in exchange for consistency conflicts being resolved at read time by either application or client code. Vector clocks can be configured to store copies of a given datum based on size and age of said datum.   There is also an option to disable vector clocks and fall back to simple time-stamp based "last-write-wins".

        <td>DynamoDB data is eventually consistent, meaning that your read request immediately after a write operation might not show the latest change. However, it also offers you the option to request the most up-to-date version of the data.

	        <td>Concurrency</td>
	        <td>In Riak, any node in the cluster can coordinate a read/write operation for any other node. Riak stresses availability for writes and reads, and puts the burden of resolution on the client at read time.

	        <td>Dedicated resources are allocated to your table (tunable via API) to meet performance requirements, and data is automatically partitiond over a number of servers to meet request capacity.

        <td>Replication</td>
        <td>Riak's replication system is heavily influenced by the Dynamo Paper and Dr. Eric Brewer's CAP Theorem. Riak uses consistent hashing to replicate and distribute N copies of each value around a Riak cluster composed of any number of physical machines. Under the hood, Riak uses virtual nodes to handle the distribution and dynamic rebalancing of data, thus decoupling the data distribution from physical assets.

			  <li>[[Replication]]</li>
			  <li>[[Clustering|Concepts#Clustering]]</li>
			</ul>

			The Riak APIs expose tunable consistency and availability parameters that let you select which level configuration is best for your use case. Replication is configurable at the bucket level when first storing data in Riak. Subsequent reads and writes to that data can have request-level parameters.

        <td>Scaling Out and In</td>
        <td>Riak allows you to elastically grow and shrink your cluster while evenly balancing the load on each machine. No node in Riak is special or has any particular role. In other words, all nodes are masterless. When you add a physical machine to Riak, the cluster is made aware of its membership via gossiping of ring state. Once it's a member of the ring, it's assigned an equal percentage of the partitions and subsequently takes ownership of the data belonging to those partitions. The process for removing a machine is the inverse of this. Riak also ships with a comprehensive suite of command line tools to help make node operations simple and straightforward.

        <td>DynamoDB requires that you specify your required read and write throughput values when you create a table â€“ throughput values can be increased and decreased later as access requirements change. This is used to reserve sufficient hardware resources and appropriately partitions your data over multiple servers to meet your throughput requirements.
