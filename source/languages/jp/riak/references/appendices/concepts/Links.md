Links are metadata that establish one-way relationships between objects
in Riak. They can be used to loosely model graph like relationships
between objects in Riak.

The Link Header
---------------

The way to read and modify links via the [[HTTP API]] is the HTTP Link
header. This header emulates the purpose of &lt;link&gt; tags in HTML,
that is, establishing relationships to other HTTP resources. The format
that Riak uses is like so:

```bash
Link: </riak/bucket/key>; riaktag="tag"
```

Inside the angle-brackets (&lt;,&gt;) is a relative URL to another object in
Riak. The "tag" portion in double-quotes is any string identifier that
has a meaning relevant to your application.

Objects can have multiple links by separating them with commas. For
example, if an object was a participant in a doubly-linked list of
objects, it might look like this:

```bash
Link: </riak/list/1>; riaktag="previous", </riak/list/3>; riaktag="next"
```

<div class="info">There is no artificial limit to the number of links an object can
have. But, as adding links to an object does increase that objectâ€™s
size, the same guidelines that apply to your data should also apply to
your links: strike a balance between size and usability.</div>

Links in the Erlang API
-----------------------

Links in the Erlang API are stored as tuples in the object metadata of
this form:

```bash
{{<<"bucket">>,<<"key">>},<<"tag">>}
```

To access the links, use "riak\_object:get\_metadata/1" to retrieve the
metadata "dict", and then retrieve the `<<"Links">>` key from that dict.
Example:

```bash
1> {ok, Object} = Client:get(<<"list">>,<<"2">>,1).
2> Meta = riak_object:get_metadata(Object).
3> Links = dict:fetch(<<"Links">>, Meta).
[{{<<"list">>,<<"1">>},<<"previous">>},{{<<"list">>,<<"3">>},<<"next">>}]
```

To store links back in the object, update the dict, update the object
metadata, and put the object:

```bash
4> NewMeta = dict:store(<<"Links">>, [{{<<"list">>,<<"0">>},<<"first">>}|Links], Meta).
5> NewObject = riak_object:update_metadata(Object, NewMeta).
6> Client:put(NewObject,2).
```

Link-walking
------------

Link-walking (traversal) is a special case of
[[MapReduce|MapReduce]] querying, and can be accessed
through the [[HTTP Link Walking]]. Link-walks start at a single input
object and follow links on that object to find other objects that match
the submitted specifications. More than one traversal may be specified
in a single request, with any number of the intermediate results
returned. The final traversal in a link-walking request always returns
results.
