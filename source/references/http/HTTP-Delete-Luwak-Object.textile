h1. HTTP Delete Luwak Object

Deletes an object from Luwak.

<div class="info">This feature is deprecated for Riak versions 1.1+.</div>

h2. Request

```bash
DELETE /luwak/key
```

h2. Response

Normal response codes:
* @204 No Content@
* @404 Not Found@

Typical error codes:
* @400 Bad Request@

Like [[HTTP Delete Object]], @404 Not Found@ is a normal response in the sense that DELETE operations are idempotent and not finding the object has the same effect as deleting it.

h2. Example

```bash
$ curl -i -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8098/luwak/file.json
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
