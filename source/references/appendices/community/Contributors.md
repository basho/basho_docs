There are many ways to contribute to Riak and the community that backs it. The two primary avenues for contribution are code and wiki documentation.{excerpt} (If you have another idea on how you'd like to contribute, great! Email _mark@basho.com_ with what you have in mind.)

This page is a listing of people who have contributed or are currently contributing to our code base and our wiki. We just wanted to say "Thanks!"

For more information on how to contribute, look through the [[Riak Community FAQs]].

### Code Contributors
