Basho maintains all of the content in the Riak Wiki in a public GitHub repo. What this means is that if you have a change you think needs to be made, all you need to do is fork the [[Riak Wiki Repo|https://github.com/basho/riak_wiki]] and send a pull request with your changes. Chances are we will merge them in short order. If we have any questions, we'll comment on the pull request.

## Who Maintains the Wiki?

The Riak Wiki is maintained primarily by the Basho Development and Support Teams. However, we do invite developers from outside Basho to have commit access to the Riak Wiki Repo on GitHub. (You can still contribute if you don't have commit access. You'll just need a committer to review your changes.)

There is a process by which community members will be granted commit access to the Riak wiki directly. Those who are granted access will join a group called the "Community Wiki Committers."

### Who will be considered for being a Community Wiki Committers?

* Those who come forward and ask for privileges. To do this, simply send an email to _+wiki@basho.com+_ and tell us why you want to edit the wiki and where precisely you can shine as a Community Editor.
* Community Members who are nominated by a member of the Riak Development or Support teams

### How will individuals be evaluated?

* Those who come forward and ask for commit rights will be evaluated on their Riak knowledge and previous contributions to the Riak Community including, but not limited to, Mailing List and IRC activity, Libraries and Projects created, and patches and code submissions.

* In the case of a member of the Riak team nominating a community member, the nominator will outline their reason for said nomination.

In both cases, members of the Basho Development and Support teams will hold a vote, via email, to approve the nominee.   Upon acceptance, the nominee will be notified via email.
