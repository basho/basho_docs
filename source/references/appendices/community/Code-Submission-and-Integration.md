### How do I submit my code to Basho?

There are several ways to submit a piece of code to the core Basho Team:

# Basho hosts its code on [[GitHub|http://github.com/basho]]. Sending us a pull request for one of these repos is our preferred method to receive code contributions and fixes.
# You can send a patch as an attachment to the [[Riak Mailing List|http://lists.basho.com/mailman/listinfo/riak-users_lists.basho.com]]. Be sure to include any additional information we'll need to asses and integrate your code.
# Lastly, you can file a new ticket via our [[issue tracker|https://issues.basho.com/]] with the code attached and a detailed write up of what you're sending us.

If you haven't done so already, we kindly ask that you read over the [[Bug Reporting Guidelines|How to Report a Bug]] before you submit a bug or patch.

### What happens after my code is submitted?

If it's more than a simple patch (documentation or typo fixes, for example), we will add it to our internal project management tools and prioritize it. You'll receive an email or comment from someone on the Riak development team letting you know we are working on integrating it. 

### Which code will be integrated into Riak?

We will definitely review your patch, and make constructive comments, but we cannot guarantee the inclusion of every submitted patch. Rest assured, if we don't take your patch, we'll do our best to give you feedback.

### How long will my patch take to review?

Unfortunately there is no concrete response to this.  We are fortunate that you, the community, are quite active and willing to contribute fixes and features to the codebase. The downside of this, however, is that the time it takes to review submissions can grow quite rapidly. Please be patient. We are working as fast as our team size and review standards permit.
