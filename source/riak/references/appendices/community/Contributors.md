There are many ways to contribute to Riak and the community that backs it. The two primary avenues for contribution are code and documentation.

This page is a listing of people who have contributed or are currently contributing to our code base and our docs. We just wanted to say "Thanks!"

For more information on how to contribute, look through the [[Riak Community FAQs]].

### Code Contributors

Please see the [[THANKS file in the Riak repo on GitHub|https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/master/THANKS]] for a mostly-complete list of people who have contributed code to some part of Riak. (If your name should be on there but it's not, please submit a pull request of email *mark@basho.com*.)

### Community Docs Committers

Community Docs Committers are non-Basho hackers who have commits access to the [[Riak Docs Repo on GitHub|https://github.com/basho/basho_docs]].
