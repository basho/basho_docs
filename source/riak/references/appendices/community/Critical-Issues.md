The Basho Dev Team does all that it can to ensure our users are kept up-to-date on critical bugs and issues that may occur. In addition to making Riak bugs public and searchable at [https://issues.basho.com], there are two additional avenues to monitor critical issues:

* [Riak Critical Issues Mailing List](http://lists.basho.com/mailman/listinfo/riak-critical-issues_lists.basho.com) - A very *low* traffic list used to disseminate information about bugs or issues that might negatively impact a production Riak cluster or deal with data integrity. 
* [Critical Issues Atom Feed](https://issues.basho.com/buglist.cgi?bug_severity=critical&bug_status=NEW&product=Basho%20IT&product=basho_bench&product=bitcask&product=ebloom&product=erlang_js&product=innostore&product=luwak&product=rebar&product=riak&product=riak_webui&product=search&product=webmachine&query_format=advanced&title=Bug%20List&ctype=atom) - This is generated by the [Basho Bug Tracker](https://issues.basho.com) and will deliver a link to any issue tagged at "critical" to your preferred Atom feed reader. (Keep in mind that the status "critical" is in the eye of the filer, and that community-logged bugs with a "critical" tag may be less severe than what Basho deems "critical".)
