This is intended to be a brief, objective and technical comparison of Riak and Couchbase (i.e. Couchbase Server).  The Couchbase version described is 2.0. The Riak version described is Riak 1.1.x. If you feel this comparison is unfaithful at all for whatever reason, please [fix it](https://github.com/basho/riak_wiki/issues/new) or send an email to **docs@basho.com**.

## At A Very High Level

* Riak is Apache 2.0 licensed; According to Couchbase, they have two free versions: Couchbase open source is Apache 2.0 licensed; Couchbase Server Community Edition (free version) is licensed under a [community agreement](http://www.couchbase.com/agreement/community)
* Riak is written primarily in Erlang with some bits in C; Couchbase is written in Erlang and C/C++

<div class="note"><div class="title">Couchbase vs CouchDB</div>Keep in mind that Couchbase and CouchDB are two seperate database projects.  CouchDB is a document database providing replication, MapReduce and an HTTP API.  Couchbase uses CouchDB as its backend, "wrapping" it with advanced features like caching, and is designed to be clustered.</div>

<div class="note"><div class="title">Couchbase 2.0</div>As of the time of this writing, Couchbase 2.0 is still in developer preview, so some of these points may change between now and the final release. <i>Caveat emptor</i></div>

## Feature/Capability Comparison

The table below gives a high level comparison of Riak and Couchbase features/capabilities.  To keep this page relevant in the face of rapid development on both sides, low level details are found in links to Riak and Couchbase online documentation.

        <td> Riak uses a data structure called a vector clock to reason about causality and staleness of stored values. Vector clocks enable clients to always write to the database in exchange for consistency conflicts being resolved at read time by either application or client code. Vector clocks can be configured to store copies of a given datum based on size and age of said datum.   There is also an option to disable vector clocks and fall back to simple time-stamp based "last-write-wins".

Under the hood, Riak uses virtual nodes to handle the distribution and dynamic rebalancing of data, thus decoupling the data distribution from physical assets.

        <td>Scaling Out and In</td>
        <td>Riak allows you to elastically grow and shrink your cluster while evenly balancing the load on each machine. No node in Riak is special or has any particular role. In other words, all nodes are masterless. When you add a physical machine to Riak, the cluster is made aware of its membership via gossiping of ring state. Once it's a member of the ring, it's assigned an equal percentage of the partitions and subsequently takes ownership of the data belonging to those partitions. The process for removing a machine is the inverse of this. Riak also ships with a comprehensive suite of command line tools to help make node operations simple and straightforward.
