In this section, weâ€™ll install Riak and build a four node cluster running on your local machine.  For production deployments, Basho [recommends a minimum of five nodes](http://basho.com/blog/technical/2012/04/27/Why-Your-Riak-Cluster-Should-Have-At-Least-Five-Nodes/). For simplicity, this tutorial uses four.

## Dependencies

Building Riak from source requires Erlang R15B01. *Note: don't use Erlang version R15B02, for the moment, as it causes an [error with riak-admin status](https://github.com/basho/riak/issues/227) commands*.

Basho's pre-packaged Riak binaries, the latest versions of which can be found in our [Downloads Directory](http://basho.com/resources/downloads/), embed the Erlang runtime. However, this tutorial is based on a source build, so if you do not have Erlang already installed, see [[Installing Erlang]] for instructions on how to do this.

For those of you like videos, here's a short video of installing Erlang from source on Linux.

## Build Riak

So now you have a copy of Riak. Time to build it. Do this by accessing the `riak` directory and running `make all`

```bash
$ cd riak-1.2.0
$ make all
```

`make all` grabs all the Riak dependencies for you so that you don't have to chase them down. This will take a few moments.

## Use Rebar to Start Up Four Nodes

Now that Riak is built, we are going to use [Rebar](https://github.com/basho/rebar), a packaging and build system for Erlang applications, to get four self-contained Riak nodes running on your machine. Tomorrow, when you put Riak into production, Rebar will enable you to ship a pre-built Riak package to your deployment machines. But for now, we will just stick to the four nodes. To start these up, run:

```bash
$ make devrel
```

You have just generated a `dev` directory. Let's go into that directory to check out its contents:

```bash
$ cd dev; ls
```

That should give you the following:

```bash
dev1       dev2       dev3       dev4  
```

Each directory starting with `dev` is a complete package containing a Riak node. We now need to start each node. Let's start with `dev1`

```bash
$ dev1/bin/riak start
```

<div class="note">
<div class="title">ulimit warning</div>

At this point you may receive a warning message to increase the number of open file handles (ulimit).  See [[Open Files Limit]] for platform-specific instructions on doing this.

</div>

Then do the same for `dev2`, `dev3`, and `dev4`

```bash
$ dev2/bin/riak start
$ dev3/bin/riak start
$ dev4/bin/riak start
```

## Test to see the running Riak nodes

After you have the nodes up and running, it's time to test them and make sure they are available. You can do this by taking a quick look at your process list. To do this, run:

```bash
$ ps aux | grep beam
```

This should give you details on four running Riak nodes.

## Join the nodes to make a cluster

The next step is to join these four nodes together to form a cluster. You can do this using the Riak Admin tool. Specifically, what we want to do is join `dev2`, `dev3`, and `dev4` to `dev1`:

```bash
$ dev2/bin/riak-admin cluster join dev1@127.0.0.1
$ dev3/bin/riak-admin cluster join dev1@127.0.0.1
$ dev4/bin/riak-admin cluster join dev1@127.0.0.1
```

If you're familiar with versions of Riak prior to 1.2, you might expect this to be the end of your
efforts. In order to give node administrators more control in matching their actions, Riak Admin
cluster commands like `join` become a queue of commands. To make the above joins take effect,
you first must review the `plan`.

```bash
$ dev2/bin/riak-admin cluster plan
```

The plan will print out a synposis of what it plans to do, and how the cluster will look
after this is completed.

```bash
=============================== Staged Changes ================================
Action         Nodes(s)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
join           'dev2@127.0.0.1'
join           'dev3@127.0.0.1'
join           'dev4@127.0.0.1'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE: Applying these changes will result in 1 cluster transition

  16 transfers from 'dev1@127.0.0.1' to 'dev2@127.0.0.1'
```

Finally, you can commit the batch.

```bash
$ dev2/bin/riak-admin cluster commit
```

<div class="info">
<div class="title">About riak-admin</div>

riak-admin is Riak's administrative tool. It's used to do any operational tasks
other than starting and stopping node, e.g. to join and leave a cluster, to back
up data, and to manage general cluster operations. You can read more about
[[riak-admin|Command Line Tools#riak-admin]].

</div>

## Test the cluster and add some data

Now we now a have a running four node Riak cluster. Let's make sure it's working correctly. For this we have a couple options. A simple option is to run the member-status command.

```bash
$ dev2/bin/riak-admin member-status
```

This will give us a high-level view of our cluster, and what percentage of a ring each node manages.

```bash
================================= Membership ==================================
Status     Ring    Pending    Node
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
valid      25.0%      --      'dev1@127.0.0.1'
valid      25.0%      --      'dev2@127.0.0.1'
valid      25.0%      --      'dev3@127.0.0.1'
valid      25.0%      --      'dev4@127.0.0.1'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Valid:4 / Leaving:0 / Exiting:0 / Joining:0 / Down:0
```

If you want, you can add a file to your Riak cluster and test it's working properly. Let's say, for instance, we wanted to add an image and make sure it was accessible. First, copy an image to your directory if you don't already have one:

```bash
$ cp ~/image/location/image_name.jpg .
```

We can then PUT that image into Riak using a curl command:

```bash
$ curl -XPUT HTTP://127.0.0.1:8091/riak/images/1.jpg \
  -H "Content-type: image/jpeg" --data-binary @image_name.jpg
```

You can then verify that image was in fact stored. To do this, simply copy the URL where we PUT the image and paste it into a browser. Your image should appear.

You should now have a running, four node Riak cluster. Congratulations! That didn't take so long, did it?

<div class="note"><div class="title">HTTP interface ports</div>The above configuration sets up nodes with HTTP interfaces listening on ports `8091-8093`. The default port for nodes to listen on is `8098` and users will need to take note of this when trying to use any of the default other-language client settings.</div>
