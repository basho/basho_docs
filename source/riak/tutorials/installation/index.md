Click the link for your operating system to see instructions on how to install Riak. But first, you must [[Install Erlang|Installing Erlang]].

  * [[RHEL and CentOS|Installing on RHEL and CentOS]]
  * [[Mac OS X|Installing on Mac OS X]]
  * [[FreeBSD|Installing on FreeBSD]]

### Upgrading

### Cookbooks

  * [[Installing With Chef]]

## Starting up

To start up a Riak node, change directory as necessary to where you installed Riak (in the source directory, it's `rel/riak/bin` and run the riak command like so:

```bash
riak start
```

To run Riak with an interactive Erlang console:

```bash
riak console
```

Once your node has started, you can double-check that it is running using:

```bash
riak ping
pong
```

The command will respond with **pong** if the node is running, or **pang** if it is not.

As you may have noticed, if you haven't adjusted your ulimit settings, Riak will warn you. You're advised to raise your open files limit when running Riak. You can read more about why on the [[Open Files Limit]] page.</div>

## Does it work?
The easiest way to test whether Riak is working is to use the `curl` command-line tool. Now that you have Riak running on your local machine, run this command:

```bash
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8098/riak/test
```

You should get a response that looks like this:

```bash
