Riak 1.2 and 1.2.1 requires [[Erlang|http://erlang.org/]] R15B01. *Note: don't use Erlang version R15B02, for the moment, as it causes an [error with riak-admin status](https://github.com/basho/riak/issues/227) commands*.

Riak 1.0 requires [[Erlang|http://erlang.org]] R14B03 or later. Riak versions prior to 1.0 will not function on the R14B02 or later. 

Riak versions prior to 0.12 will not function on the R14 series of Erlang. For Erlang to build and install, you must have a GNU-compatible build system, and the development bindings of ncurses and openssl.

<div class="title">Erlang Version Note</div>
The Riak binary packages for Debian and Ubuntu, Mac OS X, and RHEL and CentOS include an Erlang distribution, and do not require that you build Erlang from source. However, <strong>you must download and install Erlang if you are planning on completing [[The Riak Fast Track]]</strong>.

## Install using kerl

You can install different Erlang versions in a simple manner with the [kerl](https://github.com/spawngrid/kerl) script. This is probably the easiest way to install Erlang from source on a system, and typically only requires a few commands to do so. Install kerl by running the following command:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.github.com/spawngrid/kerl/master/kerl; chmod a+x kerl
```

To compile Erlang as 64-bit on Mac OS X, you need to instruct kerl to pass the correct flags to the `configure` command. The easiest way to do this is by creating a `~/.kerlrc` file with the following contents:

```text
KERL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="--disable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads
                        --enable-kernel-poll  --enable-darwin-64bit"
```

Building with kerl on GNU/Linux has the same prerequisites that building from source does.

Building the Erlang release of your choice is one command; as of Riak version 1.2, you should build and use Erlang version R15B01 like this:

```bash
./kerl build R15B01 r15b01
```

This builds the Erlang distribution, and does all the steps required to manually install Erlang for you.

When successfully built you can install the build using:

```bash
./kerl install r15b01 ~/erlang/r15b01
. ~/erlang/r15b01/activate
```

The last line activates the Erlang build that was just installed into `/opt/erlang/r15b01`. See the [[kerl readme|https://github.com/spawngrid/kerl]] for more details on the available commands.

If you prefer to install Erlang manually from the source code, the following will show you how.

## Installing on GNU/Linux
Most GNU/Linux distributions do not make the most recent Erlang release available, **so you will need to install from source**.

First, make sure you have a compatible build system and the `ncurses` and `openssl` development libraries installed. On Debian/Ubuntu use this command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev openssl libssl-dev
```

On RHEL/CentOS use this command:

```bash
sudo yum install gcc glibc-devel make ncurses-devel openssl-devel autoconf
```

Next, download, build and install Erlang:

```bash
wget http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_R15B01.tar.gz
tar zxvf otp_src_R15B01.tar.gz
cd otp_src_R15B01
./configure && make && sudo make install
```

## Installing on Mac OS X
You can install Erlang in several ways on OS X: from source, with Homebrew, or with MacPorts.

### Source
To build from source, you must have XCode tools installed from the CD that came with your Mac or from the Apple [[Developer website|http://developer.apple.com/]].

First, download and unpack the source:

```bash
curl -O http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_R15B01.tar.gz
tar zxvf otp_src_R15B01.tar.gz
cd otp_src_R15B01
```

Next, configure Erlang.

**Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) and Lion (OS X 10.7)**
If you're on Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) or Lion (OS X 10.7) you can use LLVM (the default) or GCC to compile Erlang.

Using LLVM:

```text
CFLAGS=-O0 ./configure --disable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads \
--enable-kernel-poll --enable-darwin-64bit
```

If you prefer GCC:

```text
CC=gcc-4.2 CPPFLAGS='-DNDEBUG' MAKEFLAGS='-j 3' \
./configure --disable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads \
--enable-kernel-poll --enable-darwin-64bit
```

**Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6)**
If you're on Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) or Leopard (OS X 10.5) with an Intel processor:

```bash
./configure --disable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads \
--enable-kernel-poll  --enable-darwin-64bit
```

If you're on a non-Intel processor or older version of OS X:

```bash
./configure --disable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads \
--enable-kernel-poll
```

Now build and install:

```bash
make && sudo make install
```

You will be prompted for your sudo password.

### Homebrew
If you want to install Riak with Homebrew, follow the [[Mac OS X Installation documentation|Installing-on-Mac-OS-X]], and Erlang will be installed automatically.

To install Erlang separately with Homebrew, use this command:

```bash
brew install erlang
```

### MacPorts
Installing with MacPorts is easy:

```bash
port install erlang +ssl
```
