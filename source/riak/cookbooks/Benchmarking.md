Basho Bench is a benchmarking tool created to conduct accurate and
repeatable performance tests and stress tests, and produce performance
graphs.

Originally developed by Dave Smith (Dizzy) to benchmark Riak, Basho's
key/value datastore, it exposes a pluggable driver interface and has
been extended to serve as a benchmarking tool against a variety of
projects. New drivers can be written in Erlang and are generally less
than 200 lines of code.

### How does it work?

When Basho Bench starts (basho_bench.erl), it reads the configuration
(basho_bench_config.erl), creates a new results directory, then sets
up the test. (basho_bench_app.erl/basho_bench_sup.erl)

During test setup, Basho Bench creates:

-   One **log process** (basho_bench_log.erl). During startup, this
    creates a new `log.txt` file in the current results directory, to
    which output is logged at the specified logging level.
-   One **stats process** (basho_bench_stats.erl). This receives
    notifications when an operation completes, plus the elapsed time of
    the operation, and stores it in a histogram. At regular intervals,
    the histograms are dumped to `summary.csv` as well as
    operation-specific latency CSVs (e.g. `put_latencies.csv` for the
    'put' operation).
-   N **workers**, where N is specified by the [[concurrent|Benchmarking#concurrent]] configuration setting.
    (basho_bench_worker.erl). The worker process wraps a driver
    module, specified by the [[driver|Benchmarking#driver]] configuration setting. The driver is randomly
    invoked using the distribution of operations as specified by the
    [[operations|Benchmarking#operations]] configuration
    setting. The rate at which the driver invokes operations is governed
    by the [[mode|Benchmarking#mode]] setting.

Once these processes have been created and initialized, Basho Bench
sends a run command to all worker processes, causing them to begin the
test. Each worker is initialized with a common seed value for random
number generation to ensure that the generated workload is reproducible
at a later date.

During the test, the workers repeatedly call `driver:run/4`, passing in
the next operation to run, a keygen function, a valuegen function, and
the last state of the driver. The worker process times the operation,
and reports this to the stats process when the operation has completed.

Finally, once the test has been run for the duration specified in the
config file, all workers and stats processes are terminated and the
benchmark ends. The measured latency and throughput of the test can be
found in `./tests/current/`. Previous results are in timestamped
directories of the form `./tests/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`.

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

-   Erlang must be installed. See [[Installing Erlang]] for instructions and versioning requirements.
-   [R statistics language](http://www.r-project.org/) must be installed if you wish to generate graphs (see the [[Generating Benchmark Graphs|Benchmarking#Generating-Benchmark-Graphs]] section, below).

### Building from Source

Basho Bench is currently available as source code only. To get the
latest code, clone the basho_bench repository:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/basho/basho_bench.git
cd basho_bench
make
```

Usage
-----

Run basho_bench:

```bash
./basho_bench myconfig.config
```

This will generate results in `tests/current/`. You will need to create
a configuration file. The recommended approach is to start from a file
in the `examples` directory and modify settings using the
[[Configuration|Benchmarking#Configuration]] section
below for reference.

Generating Benchmark Graphs
---------------------------

The output of basho_bench can be used to create graphs showing:

-   Throughput - Operations per second over the duration of the test.
-   Latency at 99th percentile, 99.9th percentile and max latency for
    the selected operations.
-   Median latency, mean latency, and 95th percentile latency for the
    selected operations.

### Prerequisites

The R statistics language is needed to generate graphs. Note: If necessary, R can be installed on a different machine than the one running basho_bench, and the performance data can be copied (via rsync, for example) from the load testing machine to the one that will be generating and viewing the graphs (such as a desktop).

-   More information: [[http://www.r-project.org/]]
-   Download R: [[http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html]]

Follow the instructions for your platform to install R.

### Generating Graphs

To generate a benchmark graph against the current results, run:

```bash
make results
```

This will create a results file in `tests/current/summary.png`.

You can also run this manually:

```bash
priv/summary.r -i tests/current
```

## Configuration

Basho Bench ships with a number of sample configuration files, available
in the /examples/ directory.

### Global Config Settings

#### mode

The **mode** setting controls the rate at which workers invoke the
`{driver:run/4}` function with a new operation. There are two possible
values:

* `{max}` --- generate as many ops per second as possible
* `{rate, N}` --- generate N ops per second, with exponentially
distributed interarrival times

Note that this setting is applied to each driver independently. For
example, if `{rate, 5}` is used with 3 concurrent workers, basho_bench
will be generating 15 (i.e. 5 * 3) operations per second.

```bash
% Run at max, ie: as quickly as possible
{mode, max}

% Run 15 operations per second per worker
{mode, {rate, 15}}
```

#### concurrent

The number of concurrent worker processes. The default is 3 worker
processes. This determines the number of concurrent clients running
requests on API under test.

```bash
% Run 10 concurrent processes
{concurrent, 10}
```

#### duration

The duration of the test, in minutes. The default is 5 minutes.

```bash
% Run the test for one hour
{duration, 60}
```

#### operations

The possible operations that the driver will run, plus their "weight" or
likelihood of being run. Default is `[{get,4},{put,4},{delete, 1}]`
which means that out of every 9 operations, 'get' will be called four
times, 'put' will called four times, and 'delete' will be called once,
on average.

```bash
% Run 80% gets, 20% puts
{operations, [{get, 4}, {put, 1}]}.
```

Operations are defined on a **per-driver** basis. Not all drivers will
implement the "get"/"put" operations discussed above. Consult the driver
source to determine the valid operations. E.g., if you're testing the
HTTP interface, the corresponding operations are "get" and "update"
respectively.

If a driver does not support a specified operation ("asdfput" in this
example) you may see errors like:

```bash
DEBUG:Driver basho_bench_driver_null crashed: {function_clause,
                                          [{{{basho_bench_driver_null,run,
                                            [asdfput,
                                             #Fun<basho_bench_keygen.4.4674>,
                                             #Fun<basho_bench_valgen.0.1334>,
                                             undefined]}}},
                                           {{{basho_bench_worker,
                                            worker_next_op,1}}},
                                           {{{basho_bench_worker,
                                            max_worker_run_loop,1}}}]}
```

#### driver

The module name of the driver that basho_bench will use to generate
load. A driver may simply invoke code in-process (such as when measuring
the performance of DETS) or may open network connections
and generate load on a remote system (such as when testing a Riak
server/cluster).

Available drivers include:

-   `basho_bench_driver_http_raw` - Uses Riak's HTTP interface to
    get/update/insert data on a Riak server
-   `basho_bench_driver_riakc_pb` - Uses Riak's Protocol Buffers
    interface to get/put/update/delete data on a Riak server
-   `basho_bench_driver_riakclient` - Uses Riak's Dist. Erlang interface
    to get/put/update/delete data on a Riak server
-   `basho_bench_driver_bitcask` - Directly invokes the Bitcask API
-   `basho_bench_driver_dets` - Directly invokes the DETS API

On invocation of the `driver:run/4` method, the driver may return one of
the following results:

-   `{ok, NewState}` - operation completed successfully
-   `{error, Reason, NewState}` - operation failed but the driver can
    continue processing (i.e. recoverable error)
-   `{stop, Reason}` - operation failed; driver can't/won't continue
    processing
-   `{'EXIT', Reason}` - operation failed; driver crashed

#### code_paths

Some drivers need additional Erlang code in order to run. Specify the
paths to this code using the **code_paths** configuration setting.

#### key_generator

The generator function to use for creating keys. Generators are defined
in `basho_bench_keygen.erl`. Available generators include:

-   `{sequential_int, MaxKey}` - generates integers from 0..MaxKey in
    order and then stops the system. Note that each instance of this
    keygen is specific to a worker.
-   `{partitioned_sequential_int, MaxKey}` - same as `{sequential_int}`,
    but splits the keyspace evenly among the worker processes. This is
    useful for pre-loading a large dataset.
-   `{partitioned_sequential_int, StartKey, NumKeys}` - same as
    `partitioned_sequential_int`, but starting at the defined `StartKey`
    and going up to `StartKey + NumKeys`.
-   `{uniform_int, MaxKey}` - selects an integer from uniform
    distribution of 0..MaxKey. I.e. all integers are equally probable.
-   `{pareto_int, MaxKey}` - selects an integer from a Pareto
    distribution, such that 20% of the available keys get selected 80%
    of the time. Note that the current implementation of this generator
    MAY yield values larger than MaxKey due to the mathematical
    properties of the Pareto distribution.
-   `{truncated_pareto_int, MaxKey}` - same as `{pareto_int}`, but will
    NOT yield values above MaxKey.
-   `{function, Module, Function, Args}` - specifies an external
    function that should return a key generator function. The worker
    `Id` will be prepended to `Args` when the function is called.
-   `{int_to_bin, Generator}` - takes any of the above `_int` generators
    and converts the number to a 32-bit binary. This is needed for some
    drivers that require a binary key.
-   `{int_to_str, Generator}` - takes any of the above `_int` generators
    and converts the number to a string. This is needed for some drivers
    that require a string key.

The default key generator is `{uniform_int, 100000}`.

Examples:

```bash
% Use a randomly selected integer between 1 and 10,000
{key_generator, {uniform_int, 10000}}.

% Use a randomly selected integer between 1 and 10,000, as binary.
{key_generator, {int_to_bin, {uniform_int, 10000}}}.

% Use a pareto distributed integer between 1 and 10,000; values < 2000
% will be returned 80% of the time.
{key_generator, {pareto_int, 10000}}.
```

#### value_generator

The generator function to use for creating values. Generators are
defined in `basho_bench_valgen.erl`. Available generators include:

-   `{fixed_bin, Size}` - generates a random binary of Size bytes. Every
    binary is the same size, but varies in content.
-   `{exponential_bin, MinSize, Mean}` - generates a random binary which
    has an exponentially-distributed size. Most values will be
    approximately MinSize + Mean bytes in size, with a long-tail of
    larger values.
-   `{uniform_bin, MinSize, MaxSize}` - generates a random binary which
    has an evenly-distributed size between MinSize and MaxSize.
-   `{function, Module, Function, Args}` - specifies an external
    function that should return a value generator function. The worker
    `Id` will be prepended to `Args` when the function is called.

The default value generator is `{value_generator, {fixed_bin, 100}}`.

Examples:

```bash
% Generate a fixed size random binary of 512 bytes
{value_generator, {fixed_bin, 512}}.

% Generate a random binary whose size is exponentially distributed
% starting at 1000 bytes and a mean of 2000 bytes
{value_generator, {exponential_bin, 1000, 2000}}.
```

#### rng_seed

The initial random seed to use. This is explicitly seeded, rather than
seeded from the current time, so that a test can be run in a
predictable, repeatable fashion.

Default is `{rng_seed, {42, 23, 12}}`.

```bash
% Seed to {12, 34, 56}
{rng_seed, {12, 34, 56}.
```

#### log_level

The **log_level** setting determines which messages Basho Bench will
log to the console and to disk.

Default level is **debug**.

Valid levels are:

-   debug
-   info
-   warn
-   error

#### report_interval

How often, in seconds, should the stats process write histogram data to
disk. Default is 10 seconds.

#### test_dir

The directory in which to write result data. The default is `tests/`.

### basho_bench_driver_riakclient Settings

```

#### riakclient_replies

This value is used for R-values during a get operation, and W-values
during a put operation.

```bash
% Expect 1 reply.
{riakclient_replies, 1}.
```

#### riakclient_bucket

The Riak bucket to use for reading and writing values. Default is
`<<"test">>`.

List of IP addresses to connect the workers to. A random IP will be
chosen for each worker.

Default is `{riakc_pb_ips, [{127,0,0,1}]}`

```bash
% Connect to a cluster of 3 machines
{riakc_pb_ips, [{10,0,0,1},{10,0,0,2},{10,0,0,3}]}
```

The bucket to use for testing.

Default is `{riakc_pb_bucket, <<"test">>}`

### basho_bench_driver_http_raw Settings

#### http_raw_ips

List of IP addresses to connect the workers to. Each worker makes
requests to each IP in a round-robin fashion.

Default is `{http_raw_ips, ["127.0.0.1"]}`

```bash
% Connect to a cluster of machines in the 10.x network
{http_raw_ips, ["10.0.0.1", "10.0.0.2", "10.0.0.3"]}.
```

#### http_raw_port

```bash
% Connect on port 8090
{http_raw_port, 8090}.
```

#### http_raw_path

Base path to use for accessing riak - usually "/riak/<bucket>"

Defaults is `{http_raw_path, "/riak/test"}`.

```bash
% Place test data in another_bucket
{http_raw_path, "/riak/another_bucket"}.
```

#### http_raw_params

Additional parameters to add to the end of the URL. This can be used to
set riak r/w/dw/rw parameters as as desired.

{http_raw_params, "?r=1&w=1"}.
```

#### http_raw_disconnect_frequency

How often, in seconds or number of operations, the HTTP clients
(workers) should forcibly disconnect from the server.

Default is `{http_raw_disconnect_frequency, infinity}`. (never forcibly
disconnect)

```bash
% Disconnect after 60 seconds
{http_raw_disconnect_frequency, 60}.

% Disconnect after 200 operations
{http_raw_disconnect_frequency, {ops, 200}}.
```

Custom Driver
-------------

A custom driver must expose the following callbacks.

```erlang
% Create the worker
% ID is an integer
new(ID) -> {ok, State} or {error, Reason}.

% Run an operation
run(Op, KeyGen, ValueGen, State) -> {ok, NewState} or {error, Reason, NewState}.
```

See the [existing
drivers](https://github.com/basho/basho_bench/tree/master/src) for more
details.
